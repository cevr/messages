# Country Living: God's Call for Today, Not Tomorrow

**Tags:** #country-living #end-time-preparation #self-sufficiency #health #spiritual-growth #last-day-events

**Opening Hymn:** #499 "What a Friend We Have in Jesus"
"What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear! What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer! O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear, all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer."

**Closing Hymn:** #547 "Be Thou My Vision"
"Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart; naught be all else to me, save that Thou art. Thou my best thought, by day or by night, waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light."

**Central Bible Verse:** Isaiah 32:18-19 - "My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places, though hail comes down on the forest, and the city is brought low in humiliation."

## Introduction
* God's ideal for His people has always included a connection with nature and the land
* **Genesis 2:8, 15** - "The LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden... Then the LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it."
* The call to country living is not just a preference but a prophetic imperative for these last days
* **Revelation 18:4** - "Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues."
* _Speaking note: "Consider how nature reveals God's character in ways that human-made environments cannot. A spider's web glistening with morning dew, a dramatic sunset painting the sky, or the intricate design of a single snowflake—these silent witnesses speak of a Creator whose attention to detail and beauty often escapes us in the noise and distraction of city life."_

## I. The Biblical Foundation for Country Living
* **Genesis 13:14-18** - Abraham lived in the country, pitched his tent, and built an altar to the Lord
* **Psalm 104:24** - "O LORD, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all. The earth is full of Your possessions."
* God's original plan was for humans to live in connection with:
  1. **Genesis 1:28-29** - The land that provides sustenance
  2. **Genesis 2:19** - The animals under their stewardship
  3. **Genesis 3:8** - The Creator who walks in the garden
* _Speaking note: "God's original GPS for humanity wasn't set to 'downtown Eden' but to 'garden of Eden.' The first home address He gave mankind had trees for neighbors and streams for streets."_
* Biblical examples of country dwellers:
  1. **Genesis 26:12-14** - Isaac sowed in the land and received a hundredfold blessing
  2. **1 Samuel 16:11-13** - David was called from tending sheep to be king
  3. **1 Kings 19:19-21** - Elisha was plowing with oxen when called by Elijah
  4. **Amos 7:14-15** - Amos was a herdsman and tender of sycamore fruit
* _Speaking note: "Notice how God often called people who had their hands in the soil and their eyes on the horizon. There's something about country living that prepares the heart to hear God's voice more clearly."_

## II. Ellen White's Counsel on Country Living
* **Country Living, p. 17** - "My warning is: Keep out of the cities."
* _Speaking note: "Some view Ellen White's counsel on country living as outdated or extreme. But consider how her warnings about city life—written over 100 years ago—seem almost prophetic when we look at urban challenges today."_
* Four main reasons Ellen White advocated country living:
  1. **Spiritual protection**
     * **Letter 182, 1902** - "The cities are filled with temptation. We should plan our work in such a way as to keep our young people as far as possible from this contamination."
  2. **Physical health**
     * **Ministry of Healing, p. 365** - "The physical surroundings in the cities are often a peril to health."
  3. **Preparation for the final crisis**
     * **Country Living, p. 9-10** - "Again and again the Lord has instructed that our people are to take their families away from the cities, into the country, where they can raise their own provisions."
  4. **Children's development**
     * **Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 326** - "No pains should be spared to select places for our schools where the moral atmosphere will be as healthful as possible; for the influences that prevail will leave a deep impress on young and forming characters."
* **Country Living, p. 24** - "It is God's design that our people should locate outside the cities... And the time is not far distant, when they will have to leave the cities."
* _Speaking note: "Ellen White's counsel wasn't meant to instill fear, but to outline God's ideal. Like a loving mother who warns her child not to play in traffic, these counsels are given to protect, not restrict."_

## III. The Dangers of Delay: Why "The Right Time" is Now
* **Jeremiah 8:20** - "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved!"
* _Speaking note: "Waiting for the 'perfect time' to follow God's counsel is like waiting for the perfect weather to plant a garden—we may end up waiting until the growing season is over."_
* The progressive nature of last-day events:
  1. **Luke 17:28-30** - As in the days of Lot, life continues normally until sudden destruction
  2. **1 Thessalonians 5:3** - "When they say, 'Peace and safety!' then sudden destruction comes"
* _Speaking note: "The frog in the gradually heating pot doesn't realize its danger until it's too late to jump out. Similarly, the progression of events may be so gradual that the optimal time for transition passes without our notice."_
* Three dangers of postponement:
  1. **Financial entrapment**
     * **Haggai 1:6** - "You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it."
     * Urban property may become impossible to sell as conditions deteriorate
     * _Speaking note: "If everyone waits until crisis hits to sell urban property, who will be there to buy it? It's like trying to sell umbrellas after the storm has already begun."_
  2. **Skill development delayed**
     * **Proverbs 22:3** - "A prudent man foresees evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished."
     * Self-sufficiency requires years of learning and practice
     * _Speaking note: "Growing food, preserving harvests, and living more simply are skills, not instincts. They're more like learning to play piano than learning to walk—they take time, practice, and many mistakes before mastery."_
  3. **Character unprepared**
     * **Luke 16:10** - "He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much"
     * The daily disciplines of country living develop essential character traits
     * _Speaking note: "Country living isn't just about growing vegetables; it's about growing virtue. The patience needed to wait for a harvest, the diligence required for daily chores, the faith exercised when facing weather challenges—these develop the character that will stand in the final crisis."_
* **The procrastination trap** illustrated in Scripture:
  * **Acts 24:25** - Felix told Paul, "Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you."
  * **Luke 9:59-62** - Various excuses for not following Christ immediately
* _Speaking note: "Moving to the country may never feel convenient or easy. But consider this: How convenient will it be to make this transition during economic collapse or when Sunday laws are enforced?"_

## IV. Physical and Mental Health Benefits of Country Living
* **3 John 1:2** - "Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers."
* _Speaking note: "God's plans for our lives always include our physical well-being. Country living isn't just a spiritual recommendation—it's a health prescription."_
* Scientific benefits of rural environments:
  1. **Psalm 104:14, 24-25** - God created nature for our benefit and enjoyment
  2. **Cleaner air and water**
     * **Revelation 7:1** - God holds the four winds, but pollution increases
     * _Speaking note: "Studies consistently show that air pollution in cities is linked to increased rates of respiratory disease, heart problems, and even cognitive decline. The Bible tells us that God provides 'the breath of life'—but in many cities, each breath includes pollutants and toxins."_
  3. **Natural light exposure**
     * **Ecclesiastes 11:7** - "Truly the light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to behold the sun."
     * Benefits for circadian rhythm, vitamin D production, and mood regulation
     * _Speaking note: "Our bodies were designed to wake with the sun and rest with darkness. Urban environments with artificial light disrupt this God-designed pattern, contributing to sleep disorders, mood issues, and hormonal imbalances."_
  4. **Physical activity integrated into daily life**
     * **Genesis 2:15** - Adam was to "tend and keep" the garden
     * Gardening, animal care, and maintenance provide natural exercise
     * _Speaking note: "In the country, exercise isn't something you drive to a gym to do—it's built into your daily routine. Gardening, chopping wood, caring for animals—these activities engage your muscles naturally while producing something useful."_
  5. **Reduced stress and mental health benefits**
     * **Matthew 6:28-29** - Jesus directed attention to the lilies of the field
     * Multiple studies show reduced cortisol levels in natural settings
     * _Speaking note: "Scientists now recognize what Scripture has always taught—nature heals the mind. They call it 'attention restoration theory,' but I call it God's original design for mental well-being."_
* **Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, p. 179** - "True education is not forcing instruction on an unready and unreceptive mind. The mental powers must be awakened, the interest aroused."
* _Speaking note: "Nature provides the ideal classroom—where learning engages all the senses and lessons are discovered rather than just delivered."_

## V. Spiritual Benefits of Country Living
* **Psalm 19:1-3** - "The heavens declare the glory of God... Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge."
* _Speaking note: "In the city, we're surrounded by human creation and achievement. In the country, we're surrounded by divine creation and achievement. Which environment do you think better nurtures faith?"_
* How country living nurtures spiritual growth:
  1. **Reduced worldly distractions**
     * **Matthew 13:22** - "The cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word"
     * Less exposure to materialistic influences and entertainment options
     * _Speaking note: "Every advertisement, storefront, and entertainment venue in cities competes for your attention and devotion. In the country, fewer voices compete with God's still, small voice."_
  2. **Nature as God's second book**
     * **Romans 1:20** - "Since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made"
     * Daily object lessons reinforce spiritual principles
     * _Speaking note: "Jesus taught using seeds, soil, weather, and wildlife. Why? Because these natural elements perfectly illustrate spiritual truths. Living among these teaching tools provides daily sermons without words."_
  3. **Privacy for deeper prayer life**
     * **Matthew 14:23** - Jesus "went up on the mountain by Himself to pray"
     * Space and solitude for uninterrupted communion with God
     * _Speaking note: "Even Jesus sought the quietness of rural settings for prayer. If the Son of God needed this environment for spiritual renewal, how much more do we?"_
  4. **Sabbath experienced more fully**
     * **Isaiah 58:13-14** - "If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath... Then you shall delight yourself in the LORD"
     * Nature setting enhances the restfulness and worship experience
     * _Speaking note: "There's something powerful about worshiping the Creator while surrounded by His creation. The Sabbath becomes not just a day off from work, but a full-sensory experience of God's original design."_
  5. **Lessons in dependence and faith**
     * **Matthew 6:26-30** - God cares for birds and flowers, how much more for you
     * Agricultural life teaches trust in God's providence
     * _Speaking note: "When your livelihood depends on factors beyond your control—weather, seasons, plant health—you learn to trust God in deeper ways. Each successful harvest becomes a testimony to divine partnership."_
* **Christ's Object Lessons, p. 24** - "Christ has linked His teaching, not only with the day of rest, but with the week of toil... In the tillage and cultivation of the soil, we are to learn the spiritual lessons He designs to teach."
* _Speaking note: "Country living doesn't automatically make one spiritual, but it creates an environment where spiritual growth can flourish naturally, like planting in fertile soil instead of rocky ground."_

## VI. Self-Sufficiency as Preparation for End-Time Events
* **2 Thessalonians 3:10-12** - "If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat... but work in quietness and eat their own bread."
* _Speaking note: "Self-sufficiency isn't about isolation or extreme individualism. It's about responsible stewardship that doesn't unnecessarily depend on systems that may one day be used to enforce conformity against conscience."_
* Biblical examples of preparation:
  1. **Genesis 41:46-49** - Joseph stored grain during the seven years of plenty
  2. **Proverbs 6:6-8** - The ant prepares food in summer for winter
  3. **Proverbs 31:16-19** - The virtuous woman purchased fields, planted vineyards, and was skilled in practical work
* _Speaking note: "Preparation isn't a lack of faith—it's faithful stewardship. Noah built the ark before it started raining. Joseph stored grain before the famine. Preparation is a biblical principle."_
* Key elements of self-sufficiency:
  1. **Food production**
     * **Isaiah 65:21** - "They shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
     * Gardening, small livestock, food preservation
     * _Speaking note: "A garden is both a practical asset and a living object lesson. As you nurture plants from seed to harvest, you experience countless spiritual parallels that deepen your understanding of how God works with human hearts."_
  2. **Water independence**
     * **Jeremiah 17:7-8** - "Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD... He shall be like a tree planted by the waters."
     * Well, spring, rainwater collection, filtration systems
     * _Speaking note: "Jesus offered the woman at the well 'living water.' In practical terms, access to clean water independent of municipal systems may one day be crucial when economic sanctions are imposed on those who keep God's commandments."_
  3. **Energy considerations**
     * **Ecclesiastes 4:11** - "If two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one be warm alone?"
     * Alternative heating, cooking, and power options
     * _Speaking note: "Energy independence doesn't mean returning to the Stone Age. It means thoughtful adaptation and appropriate technology that frees you from dependence on systems that may one day require compromise to access."_
  4. **Practical skills development**
     * **Exodus 35:30-35** - God filled Bezalel with skill, ability, and knowledge in all kinds of crafts
     * Learning basic repairs, construction, and traditional crafts
     * _Speaking note: "There's a deep satisfaction in creating or fixing something with your own hands. These skills not only prepare you for self-sufficiency but connect you with the Creator, who designed humans as co-creators and problem-solvers."_
  5. **Community interdependence**
     * **Ecclesiastes 4:9-12** - "Two are better than one... Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him."
     * Building networks of like-minded believers with complementary skills
     * _Speaking note: "True self-sufficiency isn't about isolation but interdependence within trustworthy communities. No one person can master every skill, but a small community of believers can create a resilient support system."_
* **Selected Messages, Book 2, p. 141** - "The time is coming when we cannot sell at any price. The decree will soon go forth prohibiting men to buy or sell of any man save him that hath the mark of the beast."
* _Speaking note: "Systems of buying and selling are increasingly becoming digitized, centralized, and controlled. The prophecies point to a time when economic participation will require compromise of conscience. Self-sufficiency reduces vulnerability to these pressures."_

## VII. Practical Steps: Making the Transition
* **Luke 14:28-30** - "For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it..."
* _Speaking note: "Transitioning to country living requires planning, but don't let the perceived magnitude of the change paralyze you into inaction. Remember, Noah didn't build the ark in a day, but he did start building when God gave the instruction."_
* Gradual approach for those who cannot make immediate transitions:
  1. **Skill development while still in urban settings**
     * **Proverbs 24:27** - "Prepare your outside work, make it fit for yourself in the field; and afterward build your house."
     * Begin with container gardening, food preservation, basic repairs
     * _Speaking note: "You can begin developing country living skills wherever you are. Start small—grow herbs in your window, learn to bake bread, practice basic repairs. These skills will serve you whether transition happens next year or next month."_
  2. **Financial preparation**
     * **Proverbs 22:7** - "The borrower is servant to the lender."
     * Reduce debt, simplify lifestyle, save for rural property
     * _Speaking note: "Financial freedom and simple living are spiritual disciplines that benefit you regardless of where you live. Beginning these practices now makes any future transition easier."_
  3. **Education and research**
     * **Proverbs 18:15** - "The heart of the prudent acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge."
     * Study agricultural methods, local growing conditions, homesteading skills
     * _Speaking note: "Use this preparation time to become a student of the skills you'll need. Read books, take workshops, volunteer on farms, and connect with those already living rurally."_
  4. **Community building**
     * **Hebrews 10:24-25** - "And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works"
     * Connect with like-minded believers for possible shared transitions
     * _Speaking note: "God rarely calls us to walk alone. Finding others with similar convictions can provide encouragement, shared resources, and practical help during transition."_
* Immediate steps for those ready to transition:
  1. **Ecclesiastes 9:10** - "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might"
  2. **Joshua 1:9** - "Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
  3. **Practical relocation considerations:**
     * Proximity to church fellowship
     * Access to missionary opportunities
     * Climate and growing conditions
     * Legal restrictions on land use
     * Affordability and sustainable living
* _Speaking note: "When making this transition, balance is key. Moving so far from civilization that you can't witness or fellowship isn't the goal. Finding that sweet spot—rural enough for the benefits we've discussed, but close enough to fulfill our mission—requires prayerful wisdom."_
* **Ministry to the Cities, p. 110** - "Not all can leave the cities at once...but as fast as it is possible, they should plan to go to the country."
* _Speaking note: "Ellen White recognized that circumstances vary. The important thing is to have the conviction and be moving in the right direction as God opens the way."_

## VIII. Addressing Common Concerns and Objections
* **Matthew 19:26** - "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
* _Speaking note: "The journey to country living often begins not with a change of address, but with a change of heart—a willingness to follow God's leading even when it seems challenging."_
* Common concerns and biblical responses:
  1. **"I need my job in the city"**
     * **Matthew 6:31-33** - "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."
     * Options: Remote work, commuting, developing rural income streams, simpler lifestyle
     * _Speaking note: "Many have testified that when they stepped out in faith to follow God's leading toward country living, unexpected doors opened for employment or simplified living that they couldn't have foreseen."_
  2. **"Rural property is too expensive"**
     * **Philippians 4:19** - "And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
     * Creative solutions: Shared purchases, starting small, less desirable locations
     * _Speaking note: "The vision of a perfect rural property can become an obstacle. Start with what's attainable—even if it's smaller or less ideal than you envisioned. Remember, Abraham lived in tents while waiting for the city whose builder and maker is God."_
  3. **"I lack the necessary skills"**
     * **Exodus 4:10-12** - Moses felt inadequate, but God equipped him
     * Learning is part of the journey; start with basics and build
     * _Speaking note: "None of us are born knowing how to garden or build. These skills are learned through trying, sometimes failing, and trying again. The process itself develops character qualities that prepare us for the final crisis."_
  4. **"My family doesn't support this move"**
     * **1 Peter 3:1-2** - Living our convictions can influence others
     * **1 Corinthians 7:12-16** - Maintaining peace while standing for truth
     * _Speaking note: "Family dynamics require sensitivity and prayer. Sometimes the best approach is to model the principles in small ways, pray consistently, and wait for God to work on hearts. Remember, God's timing is perfect."_
  5. **"What about fulfilling the gospel commission?"**
     * **Acts 1:8** - Being witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth
     * Rural living can position believers as lights in dark places
     * _Speaking note: "Country living actually enhances our witness in many ways. Like the Waldenses who preserved truth in mountain valleys, rural believers can establish centers of influence that draw seekers away from worldly distractions."_
* **Last Day Events, p. 95** - "Our restaurants must be in the cities... Our sanitariums are located outside of the cities... but our workers may live in sinful surroundings in order to point sinners to the path to heaven."
* _Speaking note: "Even in advocating country living, Ellen White recognized the need for a balanced approach that allows for fulfilling our mission to reach souls. Wisdom and prayer should guide each family's decisions."_

## IX. The Urgency of the Current Signs
* **Matthew 16:2-3** - "When it is evening you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red'... Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times."
* _Speaking note: "Just as sailors and farmers learned to read the skies for weather forecasting, we must learn to read current events in light of prophecy. The clouds are gathering, and wise stewards prepare before the storm."_
* Current developments that indicate urgency:
  1. **Economic instability**
     * **James 5:1-3** - Warnings about uncertain riches in the last days
     * Increasing inflation, supply chain vulnerabilities, food security concerns
     * _Speaking note: "The economic systems of our world are increasingly fragile and interconnected. When one part falters, the effects ripple globally. Self-sufficiency provides a buffer against these uncertainties."_
  2. **Technological surveillance and control**
     * **Revelation 13:16-17** - No one can buy or sell without the mark
     * Digital currencies, biometric identification, social credit systems
     * _Speaking note: "Technologies are rapidly developing that could easily enable the prophesied restrictions on buying and selling. These systems are being implemented incrementally, making it difficult to identify a clear moment of crisis."_
  3. **Natural disasters and climate concerns**
     * **Luke 21:25-26** - Distress and perplexity at the roaring of the sea and waves
     * Increasing frequency and severity of weather events
     * _Speaking note: "Whether you attribute changes to natural cycles or human activity, the reality is that food production systems are under increasing stress from unpredictable weather patterns. Personal food production provides a measure of security."_
  4. **Societal moral decay**
     * **2 Timothy 3:1-5** - "In the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves..."
     * Increasing violence, addiction, and breakdown of family structures
     * _Speaking note: "Cities often concentrate and amplify the moral challenges of our age. Rural settings, while not perfect, can provide some insulation from these influences, especially for raising children."_
* **Great Controversy, p. 622** - "Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the Lord such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times."
* _Speaking note: "Country living provides the environment where this revival can flourish—quiet for prayer and Bible study, fewer distractions, closer communion with God through nature, and opportunities to develop the character qualities needed for end-time witness."_

## X. Conclusion: The Promise of God's Guidance
* **Psalm 32:8** - "I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye."
* _Speaking note: "The most important preparation isn't stockpiling supplies or mastering skills—it's developing an intimate relationship with our Guide, who has promised to lead us through the final events of earth's history."_
* Final encouragements from Scripture:
  1. **Isaiah 30:21** - "Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, 'This is the way, walk in it,' whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left."
  2. **Psalm 37:3** - "Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness."
  3. **Proverbs 3:5-6** - "Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths."
* Three final principles to remember:
  1. **Act on what you know now**
     * **James 4:17** - "To him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin."
     * Begin where you are with what you have
  2. **Trust God's timing and providence**
     * **Ecclesiastes 3:1** - "To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven."
     * God opens doors we cannot see
  3. **Keep the ultimate goal in view**
     * **Hebrews 11:13-16** - The patriarchs lived as strangers and pilgrims, seeking a heavenly country
     * Country living is not the final destination but preparation for our eternal home
* **Appeal and commitment invitation:**
  * **For those convinced but hesitant:** Will you commit to taking the first step in planning your transition this week?
  * **For those already in transition:** Will you commit to developing one new self-sufficiency skill this month?
  * **For those unable to relocate immediately:** Will you begin implementing country living principles where you are?
* _Speaking note: "Heaven will be worth every sacrifice, every inconvenience, and every challenge faced in following God's guidance. The question is not whether we can afford to follow His counsel on country living, but whether we can afford not to."_
* Closing prayer for divine guidance and courage to follow His leading
