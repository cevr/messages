# Preparing Hearts: The Essential Groundwork of Evangelism

**Tags:** #evangelism #preparation #spiritual-growth #prayer #community-outreach #discipleship

**Opening Hymn:** #369 "Bringing in the Sheaves"
"Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness, sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve; waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping, we shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves."

**Closing Hymn:** #367 "Rescue the Perishing"
"Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen, tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save."

**Central Bible Verse:** Isaiah 28:24-25 - "Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?"

## Introduction (7 min)

- The often-overlooked first phase of evangelism: preparation
- **Jeremiah 4:3** - "For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns."
- _Speaking note: "Many evangelistic efforts fail not because the message was wrong, but because we began sowing before the ground was ready. Tonight we explore the biblical foundation for spiritual soil preparation."_
- Christ's parable of the sower: the stark contrast in results based on soil conditions
- **Matthew 13:8, 23** - "But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold... But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it."
- _Speaking note: "Notice that in Christ's parable, the seed and the sower were identical in all cases—only the soil condition changed. Tonight we'll learn how to prepare soil that yields a hundredfold harvest."_

## I. Understanding the Soil: Assessing Community Needs (10 min)

- **Nehemiah 2:11-16** - Nehemiah's nighttime inspection of Jerusalem's walls
- The principle of careful assessment before action
- _Speaking note: "Before Nehemiah announced his rebuilding plans, he conducted a thorough assessment of Jerusalem's condition. Similarly, before we begin evangelistic work, we must understand our community's actual needs, not just our assumptions about them."_

- Three levels of community assessment:

  1. **Demographic understanding** - who lives in your community

     - **Acts 17:16-23** - Paul's observations of Athens before his presentation
     - _Speaking note: "Paul didn't deliver a standardized sermon in Athens—he first observed their culture, read their literature, and noted their spiritual hunger. This informed how he presented truth."_
     - Practical tools: census data, community surveys, local history research

  2. **Needs assessment** - identifying felt and unfelt needs

     - **Matthew 9:36** - "But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd."
     - _Speaking note: "Christ saw beyond surface problems to deeper spiritual needs. Imagine a doctor who treats only symptoms without addressing underlying conditions. Effective evangelism addresses both felt needs and deeper spiritual hunger."_
     - Common community needs: family stability, financial wisdom, health concerns, meaning and purpose

  3. **Spiritual mapping** - understanding existing religious influences
     - **Acts 19:35-37** - Understanding Ephesus's devotion to Diana
     - _Speaking note: "Paul understood that Ephesus was dominated by the cult of Diana, with economic, social and spiritual implications. Similarly, we need to understand what 'gods' our communities worship—materialism, pleasure, self-sufficiency—to address these strongholds effectively."_
     - Identifying local worldviews, barriers to belief, and spiritual openness

- **Proverbs 18:13** - "He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him."
- _Speaking note: "Thorough assessment prevents us from answering questions no one is asking or offering solutions to non-existent problems. It helps us meet people where they actually are, not where we assume them to be."_

## II. Clearing the Ground: Addressing Misconceptions (12 min)

- **Luke 3:4-5** - "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low."
- The work of removing obstacles before truth can take root
- _Speaking note: "John the Baptist's ministry was preparatory—clearing obstacles before the Messiah's appearance. Similarly, before many will consider biblical truth, misconceptions about God, the Bible, and the church must be addressed."_

- Three major categories of misconceptions requiring attention:

  1. **Theological misconceptions** - false ideas about God and Scripture

     - **John 4:19-24** - Jesus addressing the Samaritan woman's theological confusion
     - _Speaking note: "The Samaritan woman held confused ideas about worship that needed correction before she could embrace truth. Similarly, many today hold distorted views of God as angry, distant, or irrelevant that must be addressed before the gospel can take root."_
     - Common modern misconceptions:
       - God as cosmic killjoy vs. the God who invented pleasure
       - The Bible as outdated vs. timeless wisdom for modern problems
       - Prayer as wishful thinking vs. genuine communion with God

  2. **Church misconceptions** - false ideas about organized religion

     - **Matthew 23:13-15** - Jesus addressing religious hypocrisy
     - _Speaking note: "One of the biggest barriers to evangelism isn't atheism but bad experiences with religion. Many reject not Christ but religious organizations that have misrepresented Him."_
     - Addressing common objections:
       - "Churches only want money" vs. biblical stewardship
       - "Religious people are judgmental" vs. Christ's compassion
       - "Churches are irrelevant" vs. meaningful community

  3. **Lifestyle misconceptions** - false ideas about Christian living
     - **Matthew 11:18-19** - Criticisms of both John (too strict) and Jesus (too lax)
     - _Speaking note: "Some see Christianity as joyless rule-following; others see it as cheap grace without transformation. Both miss the biblical balance of joyful obedience flowing from a transformed heart."_
     - Correcting distortions:
       - Christianity as burden vs. freedom
       - Obedience as legalism vs. loving response
       - Faith as private opinion vs. life-organizing principle

- **Isaiah 40:4** - "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain."
- _Speaking note: "Like road builders preparing for a royal visit, we clear away misconceptions so truth can travel unhindered into hearts. This isn't defending the church but clarifying who God truly is."_

## III. Tilling the Soil: Prayer and Spiritual Warfare (12 min)

- **2 Corinthians 10:4-5** - "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds; Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God"
- The spiritual dimension of evangelistic preparation
- _Speaking note: "No farmer would attempt to plant in concrete—soil must be broken up. Similarly, before truth can penetrate, spiritual hardness must be addressed through prayer."_

- Three aspects of spiritual soil preparation:

  1. **Intercessory prayer** - pleading for specific individuals

     - **Job 42:10** - "And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends"
     - _Speaking note: "Prayer is not merely preparation for the work—it is the work. Through intercession, we participate in God's heart for the lost and invite divine intervention in resistant hearts."_
     - Practical applications:
       - Prayer mapping: identifying and praying for specific neighborhoods
       - Prayer partners: teaming up for consistent intercession
       - Prayer walking: on-site, location-specific prayer

  2. **Spiritual resistance** - addressing demonic opposition

     - **Ephesians 6:12** - "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world"
     - _Speaking note: "Just as farmers must deal with pests that would destroy crops, evangelism encounters spiritual forces that resist truth. This isn't about dramatic confrontations but persistent, scripture-based prayer that claims Christ's victory."_
     - Biblical principles:
       - Authority based in Christ's victory, not personal power
       - Truth as the primary weapon against deception
       - Consistent resistance rather than occasional "battles"

  3. **Corporate prayer movements** - uniting for breakthrough
     - **Acts 1:14, 2:1** - "These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication... they were all with one accord in one place."
     - _Speaking note: "The greatest evangelistic explosion in history—Pentecost—followed ten days of united prayer. Modern research confirms this pattern: significant church growth almost always follows united, persistent prayer movements."_
     - Historical examples:
       - The Great Awakening and prayer societies
       - Modern prayer movements preceding church growth
       - Ellen White's emphasis on prayer preceding evangelism

- **Hosea 10:12** - "Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you."
- _Speaking note: "Prayer doesn't manipulate God into blessing our plans but aligns us with His purposes. It doesn't force people to convert but creates spiritual space where the Holy Spirit can work unhindered."_

## IV. Enriching the Soil: Relationship Building (10 min)

- **1 Corinthians 3:5-7** - "I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
- The collaborative, sequential nature of evangelism
- _Speaking note: "In agriculture, soil nutrients determine crop yield. In evangelism, relationships provide the nutrients in which truth can flourish. Before people care what we know, they need to know that we care."_

- Four relationship-building approaches:

  1. **Non-threatening contact points** - creating natural connections

     - **Acts 17:17** - "Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
     - _Speaking note: "Paul used existing social gathering places—synagogues and marketplaces—for initial connections. Similarly, we need appropriate settings where relationships can form naturally without pressure."_
     - Modern applications:
       - Community service events
       - Interest-based activities (health seminars, cooking classes)
       - Family-oriented programs

  2. **Intentional hospitality** - opening homes and hearts

     - **Romans 12:13** - "Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality."
     - _Speaking note: "In our increasingly isolated society, genuine hospitality has become a radical act. Opening our homes creates sacred spaces where authentic relationships can develop."_
     - Practical hospitality:
       - Regular meal-sharing with neighbors and colleagues
       - Creating holiday traditions that include non-church friends
       - Hosting small discussion groups in homes

  3. **Active listening** - understanding before being understood

     - **James 1:19** - "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath."
     - _Speaking note: "True evangelism begins with two open ears, not one open mouth. Through genuine listening, we earn the right to be heard and discover how God is already working in someone's life."_
     - Listening skills:
       - Asking thoughtful questions rather than waiting to speak
       - Validating experiences without judgment
       - Discerning spiritual hunger beneath surface questions

  4. **Authentic sharing** - modeling transparent faith
     - **1 Thessalonians 2:8** - "So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us."
     - _Speaking note: "Notice Paul's language—'our own souls,' not just our message. Effective evangelism shares both doctrine and authentic life experience, including struggles and growth."_
     - Balanced transparency:
       - Sharing personal faith journey, including challenges
       - Admitting questions while affirming core convictions
       - Demonstrating faith lived out in daily decisions

- **Acts 2:46-47** - "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."
- _Speaking note: "Notice the sequence: daily fellowship, genuine community, public favor, then church growth. Authentic relationships created the environment where evangelism flourished naturally."_

## V. Testing the Soil: Assessing Spiritual Receptivity (9 min)\*

- **Matthew 10:11-14** - "And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence... And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet."
- Christ's instruction to focus on receptive hearts
- _Speaking note: "Jesus didn't instruct His disciples to invest equal time everywhere but to identify receptive households. This doesn't mean abandoning anyone but stewardly focusing limited resources where the soil is ready."_

- Four levels of spiritual receptivity:

  1. **Actively resistant** - opposed to spiritual conversations

     - **Matthew 7:6** - "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine"
     - _Speaking note: "With resistant individuals, continued prayer and loving service are appropriate, but argumentative Bible studies aren't. Like a farmer who doesn't waste seed on concrete, we show wisdom by recognizing when hearts aren't ready."_
     - Appropriate approaches:
       - Consistent prayer without pressure
       - Unconditional friendship and service
       - Patience for God's timing

  2. **Casually curious** - intellectually interested but personally distant

     - **John 3:1-10** - Nicodemus's initial nighttime enquiry
     - _Speaking note: "Nicodemus began with intellectual curiosity that later deepened to commitment. With the casually curious, we provide thoughtful answers without demanding immediate decisions."_
     - Effective responses:
       - Answering questions without overwhelming
       - Providing resources for further exploration
       - Maintaining contact without pressure

  3. **Actively seeking** - pursuing answers to spiritual questions

     - **Acts 8:26-39** - The Ethiopian eunuch reading Isaiah
     - _Speaking note: "The Ethiopian was actively seeking before Philip arrived. God often prepares hearts through life circumstances, creating 'divine appointments' with those already on a spiritual search."_
     - Recognition signs:
       - Asking deeper questions about meaning and purpose
       - Experiencing life transitions or challenges
       - Expressing dissatisfaction with current worldview

  4. **Ripe for harvest** - ready for commitment
     - **Acts 16:30** - The Philippian jailer asking, "What must I do to be saved?"
     - _Speaking note: "Some individuals experience a crisis of faith that creates immediate openness. These individuals need clear invitations to decision and immediate integration into supportive community."_
     - Appropriate responses:
       - Clear invitations to commitment
       - Immediate follow-up and discipleship
       - Integration into church community

- **John 4:35** - "Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."
- _Speaking note: "Spiritual receptivity isn't static—it changes with life circumstances and divine timing. The key is discerning where each person is now and responding appropriately, neither rushing ahead nor lagging behind God's work."_

## VI. Preparing the Sowers: Personal and Corporate Readiness (10 min)

- **2 Timothy 2:20-21** - "But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work."
- The necessity of prepared messengers
- _Speaking note: "In agriculture, both soil and farmer must be prepared. Even the richest soil yields nothing without a prepared sower. Similarly, personal and corporate readiness are essential for effective evangelism."_

- Three dimensions of sower preparation:

  1. **Personal spiritual preparation** - individual readiness

     - **Isaiah 6:5-8** - Isaiah's purification before commissioning
     - _Speaking note: "Isaiah couldn't say 'Here am I, send me' until his own lips were cleansed. Similarly, our effectiveness in reaching others is directly connected to our personal walk with God."_
     - Essential preparations:
       - Regular devotional life and Scripture study
       - Confession and repentance of known sin
       - Cultivation of genuine compassion for the lost

  2. **Skill development** - practical evangelistic training

     - **2 Timothy 2:15** - "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
     - _Speaking note: "While the Holy Spirit empowers evangelism, He doesn't replace human preparation. Like a farmer who studies agricultural methods, we should continually develop our skills in sharing faith effectively."_
     - Key skill areas:
       - Bible knowledge and teaching ability
       - Cultural relevance and communication skills
       - Listening and relationship-building abilities

  3. **Corporate unity** - church-wide alignment
     - **John 17:21, 23** - "That they all may be one... that the world may believe that thou hast sent me... that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me"
     - _Speaking note: "Jesus directly connected unity with effective witness. Disunity within a church creates toxic soil where evangelism struggles to bear fruit."_
     - Practical applications:
       - Resolving conflicts before evangelistic initiatives
       - Developing unified vision for outreach
       - Creating seamless pathways from first contact to discipleship

- **1 Peter 3:15-16** - "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: Having a good conscience."
- _Speaking note: "Notice the sequence: first personal sanctification, then ready answers, delivered with the right attitude. This is the biblical pattern for prepared sowers."_

## Conclusion and Appeal (10 min)

- **Hosea 10:12** - "Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you."
- Review of the soil preparation principles and their integration
- _Speaking note: "Thorough ground preparation may seem slow and unglamorous, but it determines harvest potential. What would happen if we spent as much time preparing the ground as we do lamenting poor results?"_

- Three levels of commitment invitation:

  1. For individual members:

     - Identify one specific soil preparation ministry to join
     - Commit to regular prayer for five specific non-believing friends
     - _Speaking note: "Everyone can participate in preparing the soil, regardless of gifts or experience. Prayer and friendship are ministries available to all."_

  2. For church leadership:

     - Develop a comprehensive community assessment plan
     - Schedule regular prayer initiatives focused on evangelistic preparation
     - _Speaking note: "Leadership determines direction. When leaders prioritize thorough preparation, the entire church culture shifts from hurried programs to effective processes."_

  3. For the entire congregation:
     - Commit to a six-month soil preparation phase before major evangelistic initiatives
     - Create a culture that values groundwork equally with public reaping
     - _Speaking note: "What if we measured evangelistic success not just by baptisms but by meaningful community contacts, authentic relationships, and prepared hearts?"_

- **John 4:37-38** - "And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours."
- _Speaking note: "The great comfort in evangelism is that we're never starting from zero. God has been working long before we arrive, and preparation work is never wasted, even if we don't see immediate results."_
- Closing commitment prayer asking for patience and diligence in preparation work
