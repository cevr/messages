**Tags:** #justification #sanctification #righteousness #grace #spiritual-growth #victory-over-sin

**Opening Hymn:** #337 "Redeemed!"

**Closing Hymn:** #518 "Standing on the Promises"
"Standing on the promises of Christ my King, Through eternal ages let His praises ring; Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing, Standing on the promises of God. Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of God my Savior; Standing, standing, I'm standing on the promises of God."

**Central Bible Verse:** John 8:11 - "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."

## Introduction

- The words of Jesus to the woman caught in adultery represent one of the most profound summaries of the gospel: "Neither do I condemn thee" (justification) and "go, and sin no more" (power for holy living)
- **Romans 5:1-2** - "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
- A common misconception divides justification and sanctification into completely separate compartments
- _Speaking note: "Think of salvation like a coin with two sides—justification and sanctification. They're distinct but inseparable, part of the same spiritual currency God provides for our redemption."_
- Today's study addresses the question: Does the power to live without sin belong only to sanctification, or does justification also contain this divine enabling?

## I. The Moment of Justification: More Than a Legal Declaration

- **Romans 3:24** - "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"
- Definition of justification: More than a mere legal transaction—a transformative encounter
- _Speaking note: "Justification is like stepping from a dark room into brilliant sunshine—it's instantaneous, but its effects are profound and transformative."_

1. **What happens at justification:**
   - **2 Corinthians 5:17** - "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new"
   - **Romans 5:10** - "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life"
   - A complete identity transformation occurs at conversion
   - _Speaking note: "Justification isn't just changing your legal status; it's like receiving a heart transplant. You don't just have a new record—you have a new heart!"_

2. **The power element in justification:**
   - **Romans 6:6-7** - "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin."
   - **Romans 6:14** - "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace"
   - _Speaking note: "When a slave is legally freed, not only does their status change on paper, but they're also physically released from their chains. Similarly, justification doesn't just declare us righteous—it breaks the chains of sin's power."_

3. **Jesus' examples of immediate transformation:**
   - **John 8:11** - The woman caught in adultery: "Go and sin no more"
   - **Luke 19:8-9** - Zacchaeus: "Today salvation is come to this house"
   - **Mark 5:1-15** - The demoniac: "sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind"
   - _Speaking note: "Notice that Jesus never said, 'I forgive you now, but you'll need to keep sinning for a while until you gradually overcome it.' He expected and empowered immediate victory."_

## II. The Misunderstanding: Separating Power from Pardon

- **Romans 8:1-4** - "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit... That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us"
- _Speaking note: "Imagine being prescribed medicine that both cures your disease instantly AND strengthens your immune system against future infection. Would you say, 'I'll take the cure now and immune support later'? No! You need both together—just as God designed justification and sanctification to work together."_

1. **The artificial division:**
   - **Titus 2:11-14** - "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world"
   - A distorted view sees grace as only covering sin, not conquering it
   - _Speaking note: "Some have created a theological Grand Canyon between forgiveness and victory—with justification on one side and sanctification on the other, connected by a narrow bridge we must walk across over time. But Scripture presents them as two rooms in the same house, connected by an open doorway."_

2. **Ellen White's unified view:**
   - "Justification is the opposite of condemnation. God's boundless mercy is exercised toward those who are wholly undeserving. He forgives transgressions and sins for the sake of Jesus, who has become the propitiation for our sins. Through faith in Christ, the guilty transgressor is brought into favor with God and into the strong hope of life eternal." (Manuscript 21, 1891)
   - "Pardon and justification are one and the same thing." (Messages to Young People, p. 35)
   - _Speaking note: "Ellen White never separated the forgiveness of sin from the power to overcome it—they come in the same divine package."_

3. **The danger of postponing victory:**
   - **Romans 13:11-14** - "And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed... But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof"
   - **2 Corinthians 6:2** - "Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation"
   - _Speaking note: "Every day we wait to claim victory over a sin, thinking it belongs to some future 'phase' of our Christian experience, is another day that sin strengthens its hold on us. God never asks us to postpone victory—He offers it now."_

## III. The Complete Work of Grace at Conversion

- **Acts 15:8-9** - "And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith"
- _Speaking note: "Conversion is like turning on a light switch in a dark room. The decision to flip the switch takes a moment, but the darkness vanishes instantly. You don't gradually move from 20% light to 40% light to 100% light—the transformation from darkness to light is immediate."_

1. **The new birth provides immediate power:**
   - **Ezekiel 36:26-27** - "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you... And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes"
   - **1 John 3:9** - "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God"
   - _Speaking note: "When a baby is born, it doesn't gradually receive life over months or years—it receives complete life at birth. Similarly, spiritual birth imparts complete spiritual life, not partial life that grows more complete over time."_

2. **The gift of the Holy Spirit at conversion:**
   - **Galatians 3:2-3** - "Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
   - **Acts 1:8** - "But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you"
   - _Speaking note: "The same Spirit who seals your justification empowers your holy living. He doesn't come in installments—partial indwelling now, fuller indwelling later. The Spirit comes in His fullness at conversion, though our awareness of and cooperation with Him deepens over time."_

3. **Biblical examples of immediate transformation:**
   - **Acts 9:1-20** - Saul's conversion and immediate ministry
   - **Acts 16:30-34** - The Philippian jailer "rejoiced, believing in God with all his house"
   - **1 Thessalonians 1:9** - "Ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God"
   - _Speaking note: "Scripture never portrays new converts as partially delivered or partially empowered, needing to grow into their victory. It consistently shows immediate transformation—a complete turning from sin to righteousness."_

## IV. Sanctification: Growth in the Power Already Given

- **2 Peter 3:18** - "But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ"
- **Philippians 1:6** - "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ"
- _Speaking note: "Sanctification isn't about gradually receiving more power to overcome sin—it's about growing in our understanding and application of the complete power already given at conversion."_

1. **What sanctification really develops:**
   - **2 Peter 1:5-8** - "Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance... For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful"
   - _Speaking note: "Sanctification is like learning to drive. When you get your license, you legally have full driving privileges immediately. But becoming a skilled driver who uses those privileges effectively takes practice and experience."_
   - Sanctification develops:
     - Our understanding of God's will
     - Our sensitivity to temptation
     - Our spiritual discernment
     - Our habits of righteousness
     - Our Christ-like character traits

2. **From victory to victory, not from defeat to victory:**
   - **2 Corinthians 3:18** - "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord"
   - **Proverbs 4:18** - "But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day"
   - _Speaking note: "God's plan isn't for us to progress from defeat to victory, but from victory to greater victory. Each victory builds upon the previous one, creating an upward spiral of spiritual growth."_

3. **The relationship between justification and sanctification:**
   - **Colossians 2:6** - "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him"
   - _Speaking note: "Sanctification doesn't add to justification; it unpacks and applies what was already given. It's like opening and using the many features of an expensive gift you received all at once."_
   - Justification contains the seed of all spiritual growth
   - Sanctification is the unfolding of that seed into full bloom
   - _Speaking note: "An oak tree doesn't need to receive anything beyond what was contained in the acorn—it simply needs time and proper conditions to develop what was already there in seed form."_

## V. Understanding "Go and Sin No More"

- **John 8:11** - "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more"
- **John 5:14** - "Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee"
- _Speaking note: "Christ's command to 'sin no more' was not a cruel demand for the impossible, but a promise of divine enabling. When Jesus tells the paralytic to 'rise, take up thy bed, and walk,' it's both a command and an enabling. Similarly, 'go and sin no more' is both an instruction and a spiritual empowerment."_

1. **Christ never commands the impossible:**
   - **Deuteronomy 30:11-14** - "For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off... But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it"
   - **1 Corinthians 10:13** - "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape"
   - _Speaking note: "God is not a taskmaster who demands bricks without straw. Every divine command comes with divine enabling."_

2. **The moment of decision versus the journey of application:**
   - **Mark 8:34** - "Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me"
   - The decision to follow Christ is immediate; the daily cross-bearing is ongoing
   - _Speaking note: "Think of it this way: When you get married, you make a complete commitment in a moment. You don't gradually become more married over the years! But understanding and living out that commitment deepens with each passing day."_

3. **Immediate victory over known sin:**
   - **Ezekiel 18:21-22** - "But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him"
   - **1 John 1:9** - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"
   - _Speaking note: "God expects us to walk in all the light we currently have—not in light we haven't yet received. Victory over known sin is immediate; victory over sins we're not yet aware of comes as they're revealed to us."_

## VI. Power Versus Habit: Breaking the Chains of Cultivated Sin

- **Romans 7:22-25** - "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind... O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
- _Speaking note: "When you're rescued from drowning, you're saved from death in an instant, but your lungs don't immediately expel all the water you've inhaled. Similarly, justification provides immediate rescue from sin's penalty and power, but the habits formed under sin's dominion require time to fully break."_

1. **Understanding the difference between power and pattern:**
   - **Romans 6:17-18** - "But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
   - Power to overcome sin comes instantly at conversion
   - Habitual patterns developed over years take time to replace
   - _Speaking note: "Imagine someone who has been imprisoned for decades. When their pardon comes, they're legally free in an instant, but they may still wake up reaching for prison bars that are no longer there. Their freedom is real, but their habits still reflect their former captivity."_

2. **The physical reality of neural pathways:**
   - **Proverbs 22:6** - "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."
   - **Jeremiah 13:23** - "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil."
   - Repetitive actions create deep neural pathways in the brain
   - New behaviors must repeatedly forge new pathways
   - _Speaking note: "Sin is like water flowing down a hillside that gradually carves out a deep channel. Over time, it becomes the path of least resistance. Even after the water source is cut off (the power of sin), the channel remains and must be intentionally filled or redirected."_

3. **From impossible to possible:**
   - **Philippians 4:13** - "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."
   - **Matthew 19:26** - "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."
   - Before conversion: breaking sinful habits was impossible
   - After conversion: breaking sinful habits becomes possible through Christ
   - _Speaking note: "Before Christ, trying to overcome sin was like trying to push a car uphill without an engine—exhausting, frustrating, and ultimately futile. After Christ enters your life, the engine is installed and running! The hill is still steep, the car still heavy, but now victory is possible."_

4. **Ellen White on habit versus power:**
   - "Bad habits, when opposed, will offer the most vigorous resistance; but if the warfare is kept up with energy and perseverance, they may be conquered." (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 655)
   - "Every impure thought defiles the soul, impairs the moral sense, and tends to obliterate the impressions of the Holy Spirit. It dims the spiritual vision, so that men cannot behold God. The Lord may and does forgive the repenting sinner; but though forgiven, the soul is marred." (The Desire of Ages, p. 302)
   - _Speaking note: "Ellen White understood this distinction clearly—God's forgiveness and power are immediate, but the effects of sin on our character formation require time and divine grace to fully overcome."_

## VII. The Practical Implementation of Grace

- **Titus 2:11-12** - "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world"
- _Speaking note: "Grace isn't just a theory or a theological concept—it's a teacher that instructs us in practical godly living. Like a master craftsman teaching an apprentice, grace both shows us what to do and enables us to do it."_

1. **Claiming immediate freedom from sinful habits:**
   - **Romans 6:11-13** - "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord... yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead"
   - **Practical steps:**
     - Specifically identify the sin to be overcome
     - Claim God's promise of victory by faith
     - Consider yourself dead to that sin—reject its identity label
     - Actively yield that area to God's control
   - _Speaking note: "You don't overcome addiction by trying harder not to be addicted. You overcome it by accepting a new identity as free, and then living from that new identity by God's power."_

2. **Developing new spiritual habits:**
   - **Philippians 4:8-9** - "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true... think on these things. Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you"
   - **Practical steps:**
     - Replace sinful habits with godly alternatives
     - Create environmental changes that support your new life
     - Establish accountability relationships
     - Schedule regular spiritual practices (prayer, study, service)
   - _Speaking note: "Nature abhors a vacuum—you can't just remove sin without replacing it with righteousness. If you clean out a garden but plant nothing new, weeds will quickly return."_

3. **Growing in areas you didn't initially recognize:**
   - **Psalm 139:23-24** - "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting"
   - **Isaiah 42:16** - "And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known"
   - **Practical steps:**
     - Regularly invite God's searching of your heart
     - Study Scripture with personal application in mind
     - Remain open to the Holy Spirit's conviction
     - Act promptly on new light as it comes
   - _Speaking note: "Spiritual growth is like cleaning a dusty room. When you first turn on the light, you see the obvious dust on tables and floors. But as you clean and the room brightens, you begin to notice dust in corners and crevices you couldn't see before."_

## VIII. Common Obstacles to Experiencing Complete Grace

- **Hebrews 12:1** - "Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us"
- _Speaking note: "The power for victory is always available, but certain obstacles can block our experience of that power—like clouds blocking sunlight. The sun is always shining above the clouds; we just need to rise above what's blocking our view."_

1. **Unbelief in God's promises:**
   - **Mark 9:23-24** - "Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief"
   - **Hebrews 4:2** - "For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it"
   - _Speaking note: "Many Christians suffer from 'functional unbelief'—they theoretically believe God's promises but practically live as if those promises aren't true for them personally."_

2. **Cherished sin and divided loyalty:**
   - **Joshua 7:10-13** - The story of Achan's hidden sin causing Israel's defeat
   - **Matthew 6:24** - "No man can serve two masters"
   - _Speaking note: "Trying to experience victory while secretly holding onto a favorite sin is like trying to drive with one foot on the accelerator and one on the brake—you'll go nowhere except in circles."_

3. **Misunderstanding the gospel process:**
   - **Galatians 3:1-3** - "O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth... Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
   - **Romans 10:3** - "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God"
   - _Speaking note: "Many never experience victory because they're working from the wrong blueprint—trying to build a structure of works on a foundation of grace, when God's design calls for both the foundation and the building to be of grace."_

4. **Lack of community support:**
   - **Hebrews 10:24-25** - "Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together"
   - **Ecclesiastes 4:9-10** - "Two are better than one... for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow"
   - _Speaking note: "God designed spiritual growth to happen in community, not isolation. Even the strongest tree struggles to survive alone on a windswept hillside, but trees growing together in a forest protect and strengthen one another."_

## IX. Living in the Reality of Complete Grace

- **Jude 24-25** - "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty"
- _Speaking note: "The same power that created the universe is available to re-create your life. The same voice that said 'Let there be light' and filled the cosmos with brilliance can speak 'Let there be holiness' and fill your life with His glory."_

1. **The glorious freedom of sons and daughters:**
   - **Romans 8:14-17** - "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God... The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God"
   - **Galatians 5:1** - "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free"
   - _Speaking note: "Living under grace isn't walking a tightrope of performance, constantly afraid of falling. It's walking in a wide open field of freedom, exploring the boundless dimensions of God's love."_

2. **Growing from victory to victory:**
   - **Isaiah 40:31** - "They that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint"
   - **2 Corinthians 2:14** - "Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ"
   - _Speaking note: "The Christian life is meant to be a series of triumphs, not a series of defeats occasionally interrupted by victory. God intends your victories to be the norm, not the exception."_

3. **Preparing for translation:**
   - **1 Thessalonians 5:23-24** - "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it"
   - **Revelation 14:12** - "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"
   - _Speaking note: "The same power that enables victory over one sin today is the power that will ultimately prepare a people to stand without a mediator in the time of trouble and meet Jesus face to face."_

## Conclusion and Appeal

- **Romans 6:22** - "But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life"
- _Speaking note: "When Jesus said to the woman, 'Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more,' He offered her complete salvation—both pardon for the past and power for the future. He offers you the same complete package today."_

1. **For those struggling with recurring sin:**
   - **Jeremiah 29:13** - "And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart"
   - **Isaiah 55:7** - "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon"
   - Appeal: Will you claim Christ's complete deliverance today?

2. **For those growing in grace:**
   - **Philippians 3:13-14** - "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark"
   - Appeal: Will you commit to grow deeper in the victorious life God has already given you?

3. **For all believers:**
   - **Ephesians 3:20-21** - "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end"
   - Appeal: Will you trust not in your own ability to overcome sin, but in His infinite power working within you?

- **Prayer:** Closing prayer.
