**Tags:** #evangelism #decision-making #soul-winning #commitment #appeals #harvest

**Opening Hymn:** #359 "Hark! The Voice of Jesus Calling"
"Hark! the voice of Jesus calling, 'Who will go and work today? Fields are white, and harvests waiting, who will bear the sheaves away?' Loud and long the Master calleth, rich reward He offers free; who will answer, gladly saying, 'Here am I, send me, send me'?"

**Closing Hymn:** #369 "Bringing in the Sheaves"
"Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness, sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve; waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping, we shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves."

**Central Bible Verse:** John 4:35-36 - "Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."
