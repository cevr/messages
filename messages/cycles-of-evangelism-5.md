"Give of your best to the Master; give of the strength of your youth. Throw your soul's fresh, glowing ardor into the battle for truth."

**Central Bible Verse:** 2 Timothy 2:2 - "And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."

## Introduction (7 min)

- The often-neglected final phase of the evangelistic cycle
- **John 4:35-38** - "And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."
- _Speaking note: "We've studied soil preparation, seed sowing, cultivation, and harvest. Tonight we address what happens after the harvest—the critical process of preserving, nurturing, and multiplying the gathered fruit. Without this final phase, our evangelistic cycle remains incomplete."_
- The tragic reality of post-baptism losses
  - Statistics on new believer attrition
  - The spiritual and emotional cost of "revolving door" evangelism
  - _Speaking note: "Recent studies suggest that across denominations, up to 50% of new members become inactive within their first year. Each loss represents not just a statistical decrease but a precious soul who glimpsed truth but didn't become established in it."_
- Overview of the biblical principles for "storing and multiplying" to be explored

## I. The Biblical Imperative: New Believers in God's Harvest Plan (10 min)

- **Matthew 28:19-20** - "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them... Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you."
- The two-part commission often divided in practice
- _Speaking note: "Notice Christ's commission contains both evangelism ('baptizing them') and post-baptism discipleship ('teaching them to observe'). We often excel at the first while neglecting the second, yet in Christ's plan they are inseparable parts of one continuous process."_

- Three biblical foundations for post-harvest ministry:

  1. **Agricultural completion model** - the full harvest cycle
     - **Deuteronomy 16:13-15** - "Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine."
     - **John 15:16** - "I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain."
     - _Speaking note: "In biblical agriculture, harvest wasn't complete until the fruit was properly stored and preserved. Similarly, evangelism isn't complete until new believers are established in faith and community. The phrase 'that your fruit should remain' reveals Christ's concern for permanence, not just initial decisions."_

  2. **Spiritual parenting model** - responsibility for nurture
     - **1 Thessalonians 2:7-8, 11-12** - "But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children... As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children."
     - **1 Corinthians 4:15** - "For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers."
     - _Speaking note: "Paul consistently used parenting imagery to describe his relationship with new believers. This reveals that evangelism doesn't end with spiritual birth but continues through nurture to maturity. Spiritual parents take long-term responsibility for those they bring to faith."_

  3. **Multiplication model** - reproductive expansion
     - **2 Timothy 2:2** - "And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
     - _Speaking note: "This remarkable verse shows four spiritual generations in one sentence: Paul, Timothy, faithful men, and others. God's plan isn't addition through evangelism but multiplication through disciple-making. Each new believer represents not just one soul saved but potentially hundreds through future spiritual reproduction."_

- **Genesis 1:28** - "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply."
- _Speaking note: "God's first command to humanity—'be fruitful and multiply'—finds its spiritual fulfillment in the disciple-making process. Just as physical reproduction perpetuates humanity, spiritual reproduction perpetuates the church. Without it, each generation must start evangelism from zero."_

## II. Establishing New Believers: The Foundation Phase (12 min)

- **Colossians 2:6-7** - "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."
- The critical first phase after decision
- _Speaking note: "The days and weeks immediately following baptism or profession of faith are critically formative. During this vulnerable transition period, new patterns and relationships must be established that support long-term spiritual health."_

- Five essential establishment elements:

  1. **Identity formation** - embracing new self-understanding
     - **1 Peter 2:9-10** - "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people... Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God."
     - _Speaking note: "New believers must transition from seeing themselves as 'interested visitors' to understanding their identity as part of God's covenant people. This identity shift provides motivation and meaning beyond specific doctrinal beliefs."_
     - Implementation strategies:
       - Teaching the biblical narrative of God's people
       - Connecting personal story to the larger biblical story
       - Ceremony and symbolism that reinforces new identity

  2. **Relationship integration** - community incorporation
     - **Ephesians 2:19-22** - "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God."
     - _Speaking note: "Faith formed in isolation typically withers when challenged. New believers need intentional integration into the relational fabric of the church—not just formal membership but genuine belonging in a spiritual family."_
     - Practical approaches:
       - Systematic introduction to diverse church members
       - Small group participation beyond the evangelistic group
       - Social engagement outside formal church settings

  3. **Habit formation** - spiritual practice establishment
     - **Acts 2:42** - "And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."
     - _Speaking note: "The word 'continued stedfastly' reveals the early church's emphasis on consistent spiritual habits. During the establishment phase, new believers need help developing sustainable patterns of Bible study, prayer, worship, and fellowship."_
     - Development methods:
       - Simple daily devotional practices
       - Weekly worship participation routines
       - Regular fellowship engagement patterns

  4. **Paradigm reorganization** - worldview restructuring
     - **Romans 12:2** - "And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind."
     - _Speaking note: "New doctrinal knowledge must be integrated into a coherent worldview that reorganizes how believers interpret all of life. This moves truth from isolated facts to comprehensive understanding that shapes values, decisions, and perspectives."_
     - Implementation approaches:
       - Connecting doctrines into unified worldview
       - Applying biblical principles to current events and culture
       - Addressing secular assumptions that conflict with biblical paradigm

  5. **Victory patterning** - early success experiences
     - **1 Corinthians 15:57** - "But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
     - _Speaking note: "Early spiritual victories create positive growth momentum. New believers need support to experience success in areas like overcoming temptation, effective witness, answered prayer, and scripture application—creating confidence for facing greater challenges."_
     - Practical applications:
       - Identifying and celebrating spiritual victories
       - Structured opportunities for manageable success
       - Testimonies of God's faithfulness in specific situations

- **Ezra 7:10** - "For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach statutes and judgments in Israel."
- _Speaking note: "Ezra's progression—seek, do, teach—illustrates the establishment process. New believers must first internalize truth (seek), then apply it personally (do), before they're ready for the multiplying phase (teach). Establishment creates this essential foundation."_

## III. Empowering Growth: The Development Phase (12 min)

- **2 Peter 3:18** - "But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
- The ongoing maturation process
- _Speaking note: "Establishment creates stability, but continued growth creates vitality. Without intentional development after initial establishment, new believers often plateau at spiritual immaturity. The development phase focuses on continued progress toward spiritual adulthood."_

- Five growth empowerment principles:

  1. **Progressive challenge** - increasing spiritual capacity
     - **Hebrews 5:12-14** - "For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again... But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age."
     - _Speaking note: "Just as physical exercise requires progressive resistance, spiritual growth requires increasing challenge. Effective development balances comfort with appropriate stretch, gradually expanding believers' capacity for greater understanding and service."_
     - Implementation strategies:
       - Graduated Bible study depth
       - Increasing ministry responsibility
       - Progressive spiritual discipline development

  2. **Gift discovery and deployment** - ministry involvement
     - **1 Peter 4:10** - "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
     - **Ephesians 4:16** - "From whom the whole body fitly joined together... according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body."
     - _Speaking note: "Service isn't just the result of spiritual maturity but a means to it. New believers grow fastest when they discover and deploy their spiritual gifts in meaningful ministry. Passive consumers rarely become mature disciples."_
     - Practical applications:
       - Spiritual gifts identification process
       - Supervised ministry apprenticeship
       - Regular service reflection and evaluation

  3. **Knowledge deepening** - thorough doctrinal grounding
     - **Hebrews 6:1-2** - "Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation."
     - _Speaking note: "Initial evangelism provides doctrinal basics, but mature faith requires deeper understanding. The development phase should systematically expand theological knowledge beyond introductory concepts while maintaining practical application."_
     - Effective approaches:
       - Intermediate and advanced Bible study curriculum
       - Targeted study of challenging doctrines
       - Exploration of biblical themes and typology

  4. **Testing and trial navigation** - growth through challenge
     - **James 1:2-4** - "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
     - _Speaking note: "Spiritual muscle, like physical muscle, develops through resistance. Rather than shielding new believers from all challenges, effective development provides support through inevitable tests, helping them extract growth lessons from difficulties."_
     - Support strategies:
       - Biblical perspective on suffering and testing
       - Mentoring through first significant challenges
       - Testimony sharing of growth through trials

  5. **Independent study skills** - self-feeding capacity
     - **Acts 17:11** - "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
     - _Speaking note: "Mature believers must transition from dependent to independent learners. Like parents teaching children to feed themselves, the development phase must equip believers with skills for personal Bible study, prayer, and spiritual growth apart from constant supervision."_
     - Skill development areas:
       - Bible study methods and tools
       - Prayer development beyond basics
       - Spiritual self-assessment capabilities

- **Psalm 92:12-14** - "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing."
- _Speaking note: "This beautiful promise describes the outcome of effective development—continual growth producing lifelong fruitfulness. The image of trees 'planted' reminds us that stability (establishment) precedes sustained growth (development)."_

## IV. Equipping for Ministry: The Reproduction Phase (12 min)

- **Ephesians 4:11-12** - "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ."
- The transition from consumer to producer
- _Speaking note: "The ultimate goal of discipleship isn't just mature believers but reproductive disciples. The equipping phase intentionally transitions believers from ministry recipients to ministry providers—from being fed to feeding others."_

- Five reproductive equipping elements:

  1. **Ministry skill development** - practical capability building
     - **1 Peter 4:10-11** - "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another... If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth."
     - _Speaking note: "Spiritual gifts provide capacity, but skills provide effectiveness. The equipping phase must develop practical ministry abilities that allow believers to confidently serve others. This includes both general discipleship skills and specialized ministry capabilities."_
     - Skill development areas:
       - Bible teaching and small group facilitation
       - Intercessory prayer and spiritual encouragement
       - Personal witnessing and evangelistic skills

  2. **Leadership identification and development** - responsibility progression
     - **Exodus 18:21-22** - "Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
     - _Speaking note: "Jethro's advice to Moses models the biblical principle of graduated leadership development. Not all believers will serve in formal leadership, but all should develop some level of spiritual influence. The equipping phase identifies and develops leadership potential at appropriate levels."_
     - Development pathway:
       - Progressive responsibility increases
       - Mentored leadership experiences
       - Specific leadership skill training

  3. **Mentoring relationships** - apprenticeship training
     - **2 Timothy 3:10-11** - "But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, Persecutions, afflictions."
     - _Speaking note: "Paul's relationship with Timothy demonstrates the power of mentoring. More than formal training, this life-on-life relationship transfers both skills and character through observation and imitation. The equipping phase must create these vital mentoring connections."_
     - Implementation approaches:
       - Intentional mentoring relationships
       - Ministry shadowing opportunities
       - Transparent sharing of both successes and failures

  4. **Teaching opportunities** - guided instruction experience
     - **Hebrews 5:12** - "For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again."
     - _Speaking note: "The natural progression of discipleship leads to teaching others. The equipping phase provides graduated teaching opportunities—from informal faith sharing to structured instruction—supported by appropriate training and feedback."_
     - Progressive opportunities:
       - Personal testimony sharing
       - Co-teaching with experienced instructors
       - Independent teaching with mentoring support

  5. **Multiplication vision** - reproducing motivation
     - **Matthew 28:19-20** - "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations... Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you."
     - _Speaking note: "The Great Commission itself is multiplicative—disciples making disciples who make disciples. The equipping phase must instill this vision of spiritual reproduction as the normal pattern of Christian growth, not a special calling for a few."_
     - Vision-building approaches:
       - Teaching the biblical theology of multiplication
       - Celebrating reproduction stories and examples
       - Creating multiplication expectation in all ministry

- **2 Timothy 2:2** - "And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
- _Speaking note: "This verse reveals not just multiplication but multi-generational impact—Paul to Timothy to faithful men to others. The equipping phase isn't complete until believers are not just serving but developing others who will develop still others."_

## V. Common Breakdowns: Addressing Multiplication Obstacles (10 min)*

- **Matthew 13:1-9, 18-23** - The parable of the sower and various growth obstacles
- The reality of growth interruptions
- _Speaking note: "Even with solid establishment, development, and equipping, various obstacles can interrupt the multiplication process. Identifying these common breakdown points allows us to address them proactively rather than losing promising disciples."_

- Five critical multiplication breakdown points:

  1. **Identity regression** - reverting to pre-conversion mindset
     - **Galatians 4:9** - "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?"
     - _Speaking note: "New believers sometimes revert to former identity markers and worldview elements under pressure. This regression undermines the foundation of continued growth and often leads to either compromise or complete disconnection."_
     - Preventative measures:
       - Regular identity reinforcement through teaching and community
       - Addressing specific identity conflicts in the local culture
       - Creating strong narratives of belonging in the faith community

  2. **Relationship isolation** - community disconnection
     - **Hebrews 10:25** - "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."
     - _Speaking note: "Relationship breakdown consistently precedes doctrinal or practice departure. When believers become isolated from meaningful spiritual relationships, all other growth areas typically suffer. Connection is the lifeblood of continued spiritual development."_
     - Intervention strategies:
       - Early warning systems for attendance pattern changes
       - Proactive outreach to those showing signs of disconnection
       - Multiple relationship anchors beyond a single connection point

  3. **Unresolved conflicts** - interpersonal barriers
     - **Matthew 5:23-24** - "Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."
     - _Speaking note: "Unresolved relational conflicts often drive people from fellowship. Whether with leadership, other members, or family, these tensions create division that stunts growth. Developing conflict resolution skills and systems addresses this common breakdown point."_
     - Effective approaches:
       - Biblical conflict resolution teaching and modeling
       - Mediation ministry for addressing tensions
       - Creating culture of confession and forgiveness

  4. **Ministry discouragement** - service burnout
     - **Galatians 6:9** - "And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
     - _Speaking note: "The multiplication phase often breaks down when promising disciples experience ministry discouragement. Whether from criticism, apparent lack of results, or simple exhaustion, this discouragement can derail even the most committed believers."_
     - Supportive responses:
       - Creating realistic expectations about ministry challenges
       - Providing adequate appreciation and feedback
       - Ensuring appropriate pacing and sabbath rhythms

  5. **Vision dilution** - losing multiplication focus
     - **Revelation 2:4-5** - "Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works."
     - _Speaking note: "Over time, the clear multiplication vision that drives the discipleship process can become diluted by competing priorities. When institutional maintenance replaces multiplication passion, the entire process gradually diminishes."_
     - Renewal strategies:
       - Regular vision recasting and celebration
       - Sharing fresh stories of life transformation
       - Evaluating all ministries by multiplication contribution

- **1 Corinthians 3:6-9** - "I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
- _Speaking note: "While we work diligently to prevent breakdown points, this passage reminds us that ultimate growth comes from God. This provides both humility when things go well and hope when they don't. We're responsible for faithful effort, not guaranteed results."_

## VI. Systemic Implementation: Creating a Multiplication Culture (9 min)*

- **Acts 2:42-47** - The comprehensive discipleship system of the early church
- Moving from individual efforts to church-wide processes
- _Speaking note: "Effective multiplication rarely happens through isolated efforts but through intentional church-wide systems. Creating a comprehensive discipleship culture requires aligned processes that support each phase of the discipleship journey."_

- Four elements of effective multiplication systems:

  1. **Clear pathway development** - structured growth process
     - **1 Corinthians 14:40** - "Let all things be done decently and in order."
     - _Speaking note: "Ad hoc approaches to discipleship produce inconsistent results. Effective multiplication requires a clear, simple pathway that guides people from initial interest through multiplication maturity with specific steps at each phase."_
     - Implementation strategies:
       - Visual mapping of the full discipleship journey
       - Simple next step clarity at each development phase
       - Regular evaluation and refinement of the pathway

  2. **Leadership alignment** - unified multiplication focus
     - **1 Corinthians 1:10** - "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
     - _Speaking note: "When different church leaders emphasize competing priorities, multiplication efforts fragment. Effective systems require leadership alignment around a shared discipleship vision, with each ministry contributing to the overall process."_
     - Alignment approaches:
       - Regular leadership vision synchronization
       - Ministry evaluation based on discipleship contribution
       - Coordinated calendar and resource allocation

  3. **Resource allocation** - strategic investment
     - **Luke 14:28-30** - "For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"
     - _Speaking note: "Resource deployment reveals true priorities. Multiplication-focused churches strategically allocate time, money, personnel, and facilities to support the full discipleship process, not just initial evangelism or maintenance ministries."_
     - Implementation principles:
       - Budget review for discipleship phase balance
       - Facility usage evaluation for growth support
       - Staff and volunteer deployment across all phases

  4. **Measurement refinement** - success redefinition
     - **2 Corinthians 10:12** - "For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
     - _Speaking note: "Traditional church metrics often measure attendance and giving rather than disciple-making progress. Multiplication-focused churches develop new measurements that track movement through the discipleship process and multiplication outcomes."_
     - New metrics to consider:
       - Tracking all discipleship phases, not just decisions
       - Measuring multiplication ratios and generations
       - Evaluating leadership development pipeline health

- **Malachi 2:15** - "And did not he make one?... And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed."
- _Speaking note: "This fascinating verse reveals God's motivation in making husband and wife 'one'—seeking godly offspring. Similarly, the church's oneness should focus on spiritual reproduction. Our unity isn't merely for harmony but for effective multiplication."_

## Conclusion and Appeal (10 min)

- **Psalm 126:5-6** - "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him."
- The promised joy of complete harvest work
- _Speaking note: "This beautiful promise captures the full evangelistic cycle—from soil preparation through multiplication. The tears of planting and the labor of cultivation are rewarded not just with decisions but with established, reproductive disciples who themselves become harvest workers."_

- Summary of the storing and multiplying process:
  - Understanding the biblical mandate for post-decision ministry
  - Establishing new believers in identity, relationships, and habits
  - Developing mature disciples through progressive growth
  - Equipping reproductive ministers with skills and opportunities
  - Addressing common breakdown points in the multiplication process
  - Creating church-wide systems that support the full discipleship journey

- Three levels of commitment invitation:
  1. For individual members:
     - Commit to mentoring one new or young believer toward maturity
     - Identify your place in the discipleship process as either recipient or provider
     - _Speaking note: "Every believer has both a responsibility to be discipled and to disciple others. Where are you in this journey, and what's your next step—receiving more development or beginning to invest in someone else?"_

  2. For ministry leaders:
     - Evaluate your ministry's contribution to the full discipleship process
     - Develop specific strategies for connecting your ministry to the next phase
     - _Speaking note: "Each ministry should see itself as part of a larger discipleship pipeline. How does your ministry currently contribute to the establishment, development, or equipping of disciples? How might it be strengthened?"_

  3. For the entire church:
     - Commit to evaluating our current discipleship system
     - Develop a comprehensive process addressing all phases
     - _Speaking note: "What if our church became known not just for evangelistic harvests but for consistent, multi-generational multiplication? This happens not by accident but through intentional evaluation and development of our discipleship systems."_

- **John 15:8, 16** - "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples... I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain."
- _Speaking note: "Notice Christ's twofold emphasis—'much fruit' and fruit that 'remains.' This captures the storing and multiplying focus—not just decisions but disciples, not just initial response but lasting transformation, not just addition but multiplication."_
- Closing prayer for wisdom and commitment to complete the harvest work
