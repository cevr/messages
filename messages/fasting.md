**Tags:** #spiritual-disciplines #fasting #prayer #sanctification #health #spiritual-growth

**Opening Hymn:** #86 "How Great Thou Art"
"O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder consider all the worlds Thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy power throughout the universe displayed. Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee; How great Thou art, how great Thou art!"

**Closing Hymn:** #462 "Blessed Be the Tie That Binds"
"Blest be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love; the fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above. Before our Father's throne we pour our ardent prayers; our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, our comforts and our cares."

**Central Bible Verse:** Isaiah 58:6-7 - "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?"

## V. Practical Application: Developing a Sustainable Fasting Practice (15 minutes)

- **Preparing for a meaningful fast:**

  1. **Spiritual preparation**

     - **Joel 2:12-13** - "Turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping... Rend your heart, and not your garments"
     - Set clear spiritual objectives for your fast
     - _Speaking note: "Begin with prayer about whether, when, and how to fast. A fast without a clear spiritual purpose is like setting out on a journey without a destination—you'll likely wander aimlessly."_

  2. **Physical preparation**

     - Gradual reduction of food intake before longer fasts
     - Increased water intake before and during fasting
     - _Speaking note: "Your body needs preparation for fasting, especially for longer periods. It's like preparing for a long hike—you don't just show up without training or proper equipment."_

  3. **Practical preparation**
     - Adjust your schedule to allow for more prayer time
     - Inform necessary people who might be affected by your fast
     - _Speaking note: "Fasting requires intentional life adjustments. You're creating space not just in your stomach but in your schedule for increased communion with God."_

- **Types of fasts for modern application:**

  1. **Normal fast (water only)**

     - Most common biblical pattern
     - Length can vary from one meal to multiple days
     - _Speaking note: "For beginners, start with a single meal or a single day. Fasting is like any spiritual muscle—it develops with practice and can be strained if overtaxed too quickly."_

  2. **Partial fast**

     - **Daniel 10:3** - Daniel's three-week partial fast
     - Examples: Daniel Fast (vegetables and water), juice fast, or abstaining from specific foods
     - _Speaking note: "The Daniel Fast—abstaining from meats, sweets, and rich foods—is especially suitable for longer periods or those with health limitations that prevent complete fasting."_

  3. **Intermittent fasting patterns**

     - Sunset-to-sunset fasting (Jewish pattern)
     - Specific meal patterns (i.e., skipping breakfast and lunch once weekly)
     - _Speaking note: "The regular practice of brief fasting builds spiritual discipline. It's like regular physical exercise—consistent moderate activity often provides more benefit than occasional extreme exertion."_

  4. **Non-food fasts for those with medical restrictions**
     - **1 Corinthians 7:5** - Temporary abstinence for prayer
     - Media fast, technology fast, or other meaningful sacrifices
     - _Speaking note: "The principle of fasting is sacrificial abstinence for spiritual focus. For those who cannot safely fast from food, other meaningful sacrifices can fulfill the same spiritual purpose."_

- **Safety considerations and balanced approach:**

  - **Matthew 9:14-15** - Christ acknowledged appropriate times for fasting
  - **Ecclesiastes 3:1** - "To everything there is a season"
  - _Speaking note: "Wisdom must guide our fasting practices. Those with medical conditions should consult healthcare providers before fasting. God doesn't ask us to endanger our health—He wants our reasonable service."_
  - Ellen White: "There are some who would be benefited more by abstinence from food for a day or two every week than by any amount of treatment or medical advice." (_Counsels on Diet and Foods_, p. 189)
  - Those who should exercise special caution:
    - Pregnant or nursing women
    - Those with diabetes or other medical conditions
    - Those with history of eating disorders
    - _Speaking note: "Just as we wouldn't advise someone with a broken leg to run a marathon, we must be mindful of individual health circumstances when considering fasting."_

- **Integrating fasting into the rhythm of Christian life:**

  1. **Regular practice**

     - **Matthew 9:15** - "The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast"
     - Historical church tradition: Wednesday and Friday as common fast days
     - Quarterly or monthly personal fast days
     - _Speaking note: "The early Christians established regular fasting patterns to maintain spiritual fitness, similar to how we might establish regular physical exercise routines for bodily health."_

  2. **Special seasons**

     - Before major decisions or transitions (**Acts 13:2-3**)
     - During periods of spiritual renewal (**Joel 2:12-13**)
     - In response to community or national needs (**Esther 4:16**)
     - _Speaking note: "Just as certain seasons of life require more intense physical effort—like training for a marathon—certain spiritual seasons call for more intense spiritual disciplines."_

  3. **Balance with celebration**
     - **Ecclesiastes 3:1-8** - "A time to weep, and a time to laugh"
     - **Isaiah 58:13-14** - Sabbath as "delight" and feasting
     - _Speaking note: "Biblical spirituality includes both fasting and feasting—recognition of both our dependence on God and celebration of His goodness. A faith without both elements becomes unbalanced."_

- **Making fasting spiritually productive:**

  - **Isaiah 58:6-7** - True fasting leads to compassion and justice
  - **Matthew 6:17-18** - Maintain normal appearance and activities
  - _Speaking note: "The time freed from meal preparation and eating should be invested in prayer, Bible study, and reflection. A fast without increased spiritual activity is merely a diet."_
  - Practical activities during a fast:
    - Scheduled prayer times replacing normal meal times
    - Scripture reading with journaling
    - Meditation on specific Bible promises or truths
    - Intercessory prayer for specific needs or people
    - _Speaking note: "Think of your hunger pangs as prayer reminders—each one a gentle nudge to redirect your thoughts toward God."_

- **Fasting in community:**
  - **Joel 2:15-16** - "Consecrate a fast, call a sacred assembly"
  - **Acts 13:2-3** - The early church fasted together
  - _Speaking note: "Corporate fasting can powerfully unite a congregation in seeking God's will or breakthrough. Like a choir whose voices harmonize, our united prayers during communal fasting create a powerful spiritual symphony."_
  - Modern applications:
    - Small group fasting for specific purposes
    - Church-wide fasting before evangelistic initiatives
    - Family fasting adapted to include children appropriately
    - _Speaking note: "When introducing children to fasting, focus on the positive spiritual purpose rather than deprivation. Perhaps begin with a single meal fast or fasting from a favorite food rather than all food."_
