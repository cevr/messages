**I. Introduction: The Drive Within (5 min)**

*   **Hook:** Universal drive: achieve, build, make a mark. Ambition = powerful force.
*   **(RQ)** Is this drive inherently good or bad? How does Scripture guide it?
*   **Problem:** 'Ambition' often negative (selfish). Yet, inaction discouraged. Biblical balance?
*   **Central Verse Intro:** Matthew 6:33 - The key filter. Redirects *what* we seek.
    `[Whiteboard: Ambition -> ? -> Filter: Matt 6:33]`
*   **Outline Preview:** Examine worldly vs. godly ambition via Scripture; learn cultivation.
*   **Goal:** Discern the difference; embrace God-honoring ambition (Kingdom-focused).

**II. Section 1: Worldly Ambition Examined (10 min)**

*   **Biblical Case Studies (Focus: Motivation & Outcome):**
    *   Tower of Babel (Gen 11:4): "make us a name." Goal: Human glory, self-sufficiency, unity *apart* from God. Outcome: Confusion, scattering (v. 7-8).
    *   Simon Magus (Acts 8:18-20): Tried to *buy* spiritual power. Goal: Influence/status via wrong means, for self. Outcome: Sharp rebuke, warning (v. 20-23).
    *   Diotrephes (3 John 1:9): "loves to have the preeminence." Goal: Personal control, position over God's people. Outcome: Rejection of apostles, division (v. 10).
*   **Identifying Characteristics (Derived from Cases):**
    *   Motivation: Self (glory, power, wealth, status, recognition). `[Whiteboard: Worldly Ambition -> SELF (Glory, Power, Status)]`
    *   Methods: Often competitive, manipulative, ignores ethics/God's will.
    *   Focus: Earthly, temporary results.
*   **Scriptural Assessment:**
    *   Vanity, futility (Eccl 2:11).
    *   Leads away from God.
*   **(RQ)** How do these motivations (making a name, seeking preeminence, buying influence) appear today?
*   **Brief Concept:** Like building on sand (ref Matt 7:26-27) - impressive exterior, faulty foundation.
*   **Core Point:** Self-centered ambition is ultimately futile and spiritually damaging.

**III. Section 2: Godly Ambition Defined (12 min) [*]**

*   **Biblical Case Studies (Focus: Motivation & Goal):**
    *   Paul (Phil 3:12-14): "I press toward the mark..." Goal: Spiritual maturity, God's high calling in Christ. Motivation: Knowing Christ (v. 8-10).
    *   Nehemiah (Neh 2:3-5, 17-18): Burdened for Jerusalem. Goal: Rebuild *for God's honor*, rally people to God's work. Motivation: God's mission, concern for His people/reputation.
    *   Jesus (John 4:34): "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me..." Goal: Fulfill Father's will perfectly. Motivation: Complete obedience and love for the Father.
*   **Identifying Characteristics (Derived from Cases):**
    *   Motivation: God's glory, His will, love for Him & others, advancing His kingdom. `[Whiteboard: Godly Ambition -> GOD (Glory, Will, Service)]`
    *   Methods: Prayerful dependence, ethical means, collaboration, faithfulness, service (1 Pet 4:10-11).
    *   Focus: Eternal impact, spiritual growth, blessing others, honoring God.
*   **Source & Nature:**
    *   Not self-generated; response to God's call, empowered by Spirit (Phil 2:13 - "God...works in you both to will and to do").
    *   Grows via relationship with Christ, Word study.
    *   (RQ) How does understanding God's love/sacrifice (Rom 5:8) reorient our desires toward Him?
*   **Brief Analogy:** Channeling a river (drive/talents) through God's design (His will/Word) to serve/build His kingdom.
*   **Core Point:** Godly ambition = Spirit-led desire using *all* for God's purposes & glory.

**IV. Section 3: Cultivating Godly Ambition (12 min)**

*   **Need/Question:** World promotes self-advancement. How to actively reorient our drive toward God's kingdom?
*   **Biblical Principle:** Matthew 6:33 - The divine priority. Seek *first*: 1) God's Kingdom (His rule, His agenda) 2) His Righteousness (His character, His way of living).
    `[Whiteboard: Matt 6:33 -> Seek FIRST: 1. God's Kingdom 2. His Righteousness]`
*   **Bridging to Practice (Exploring Matt 6:33):**
    *   Not passivity, but *active seeking* of the *right things*. Transforms *how* & *why* we strive.
    *   (RQ) What does 'seeking His kingdom' look like in daily choices (job, time, money, relationships)? How does it change priorities?
    *   (RQ) What does 'seeking His righteousness' mean for our character, integrity, interactions? (Ref Micah 6:8).
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Matt 6:33 & related principles):**
    *   1.  **Pray for Purified Motives:** Ask God to align desires with His (Ps 139:23-24). "Lord, help me seek *Your* kingdom first."
    *   2.  **Immerse in God's Priorities:** Study Scripture to know what God values (2 Tim 2:15). Let His Word define "success."
    *   3.  **Prioritize Service over Status:** Use gifts to serve/build up others (Gal 5:13; Mark 10:43-45). Focus on contribution, not position.
        `[Whiteboard: Actions: Pray (Motives), Study (Priorities), Serve (Others)]`
*   **Invitation:** Evaluate your driving ambitions this week. Commit one area to consciously seeking God's kingdom/righteousness first.

**V. Conclusion & Invitation (6 min)**

*   **Recap:** Worldly ambition -> Self -> Vanity. Godly ambition -> God/Others -> Purpose. (Ref Whiteboard).
*   **Centrality of Matt 6:33:** Profound simplicity - Prioritize God. Ambitions find right place/power.
*   **(RQ)** Revisit Phil 3:14 - What "prize" are *you* pressing toward? Is it God's high calling?
*   **Eternal Perspective:** Focus on faithfulness & eternal value, not just earthly results (2 Cor 4:17-18).
*   **Gentle Invitation:** Don't suppress God-given drive; *redeem* it. Channel energy/talents toward His kingdom & righteousness. Ask Him to open your eyes (Closing Hymn theme).
*   **Final Thought:** True achievement = aligning life with God's eternal purposes. Strive for *that*.
