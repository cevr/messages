**Central Bible Verse:** Hebrews 8:5 - "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount."

## Introduction: The Sanctuary as Prophetic Timeline

- **Psalm 77:13** - "Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary"
  - The sanctuary reveals God's plan across salvation history
  - _Speaking note: "The sanctuary is God's prophetic roadmap—revealing not just Christ's complete ministry but also the progressive development of His church through history."_

- **Exodus 25:8-9** - "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them"
  - Four distinct zones in sanctuary service correlate to four phases of:
    1. Christ's complete redemptive ministry
    2. Church development through history
  - _Speaking note: "The sanctuary's four zones aren't arbitrary architectural features but a divine revelation of how Christ's ministry would unfold and how His church would develop across time."_

## I. The Four Sanctuary Zones: Overview of the Complete Pattern
