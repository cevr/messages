**Tags:** #sanctuary #day-of-atonement #judgment #intercession #priesthood

**Opening Hymn:** #517 "My Faith Looks Up to Thee"
"My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Savior divine! Now hear me while I pray, take all my guilt away, O let me from this day be wholly Thine!"

**Closing Hymn:** #417 "O Solemn Thought"
"O solemn thought! and can it be The hour of Judgment now is come..."

**Central Bible Verse:** Hebrews 8:1-2 - "Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."

## Introduction: God's Visual Aid for Salvation

- **Exodus 25:8** - "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them"
  - The sanctuary represents God's desire for relationship, not just ritual
  - _Speaking note: "The sanctuary is God's object lesson of salvation—like a 3D model teaching complex truths through tangible symbols."_

- **Psalm 77:13** - "Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary"
  - The sanctuary reveals God's plan of redemption
  - _Speaking note: "Just as we use diagrams to explain complex processes, God designed the sanctuary to explain His plan to save humanity."_

## I. The Sanctuary Structure: A Divine Blueprint

- **Exodus 25:9** - Built according to a heavenly pattern
  - Not human invention but divine revelation

- Three main compartments with distinct purposes:
  1. **Outer Court** - Altar of sacrifice and laver (justification)
     - Represents Christ's death and initial cleansing

  2. **Holy Place** - Daily priestly ministry (sanctification)
     - Lampstand: Christ as Light of the World
     - Table of Showbread: Christ as Bread of Life
     - Altar of Incense: Prayer and intercession

  3. **Most Holy Place** - Yearly Day of Atonement (glorification)
     - Ark of Covenant: God's law and mercy united
     - _Speaking note: "These three areas map our spiritual journey—justification at the altar, sanctification in daily walk, and final preparation in judgment."_

## II. Christ as the Ultimate Sacrifice

- **John 1:29** - "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"
  - All sacrifices pointed to Messiah

- The sin transfer process:
  1. Sinner brought unblemished animal
  2. Confession while laying hands on animal's head
  3. Sinner (not priest) slew the animal
  4. Priest applied blood according to specific rules
  - _Speaking note: "The sinner killing the sacrifice illustrated personal responsibility for sin's consequences—our sins drove the nails into Christ's hands."_

## III. Christ as Our High Priest

- **Hebrews 4:15-16** - Priest as compassionate mediator
  - Understanding human weakness through shared experience

- **Hebrews 7:25** - "He ever liveth to make intercession for us"
  - Christ's ongoing heavenly ministry applying His sacrifice

- Contrasts between earthly and heavenly priests:
  - Earthly priests: many, sinful, temporary
  - Heavenly Priest: one, sinless, eternal
  - _Speaking note: "The limitations of human priests weren't flaws but pointers to our need for a perfect Priest—Christ, whose ministry is eternal."_

## IV. The Day of Atonement: Model of Final Judgment

- **Leviticus 16** - Annual cleansing of sanctuary from accumulated sin
  - _Speaking note: "The sanctuary functioned as God's 'sin processing center'—the Day of Atonement was the annual 'system cleansing.'"_

- The essential process:
  1. High priest's special preparation
  2. Two goats selected:
     - Lord's goat: sacrifice for atonement
     - Scapegoat: removal of sin
  3. Blood applied to cleanse Most Holy Place
  4. Sins placed on scapegoat and removed from camp
  - _Speaking note: "These two goats represent complete solution to sin—forgiveness through Christ's death and final removal of sin at the end."_

- Required individual response:
  - Soul-searching, humility, active participation
  - _Speaking note: "The Day of Atonement required personal involvement—no one could be passive or indifferent."_

## V. Christ's Two-Phase Heavenly Ministry

- **Hebrews 8:1-5** - Christ ministers in the true sanctuary in heaven
  - Earthly sanctuary was a copy and shadow

- Two phases of Christ's heavenly ministry:
  1. **Holy Place Ministry (31 AD to 1844)**
     - Application of sacrifice benefits
     - Forgiveness and transformation for believers
     - _Speaking note: "For most of Christian history, Christ has been applying His sacrifice to repentant believers—like the daily services of the earthly sanctuary."_

  2. **Most Holy Place Ministry (since 1844)**
     - Investigative judgment
     - Cleansing heavenly sanctuary records
     - _Speaking note: "In 1844, Christ's ministry entered its final phase—the pre-advent judgment preparing for His return."_

## VI. The Investigative Judgment

- **Daniel 7:9-10, 8:14** - "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed"
  - 2300 year prophecy extending from 457 BC to 1844 AD

- Nature of the judgment:
  1. Examination of life records
  2. Determination of who receives eternal life
  3. Vindication of God's justice before the universe
  - _Speaking note: "This judgment isn't about God needing information but demonstrating the fairness of His decisions before the watching universe."_

- **1 Peter 4:17** - "Judgment must begin at the house of God"
  - Focus on professed believers, not the world
  - _Speaking note: "The investigative judgment concerns those who claim to follow God—examining whether profession matches practice."_

## VII. Christ's Advocacy for Believers

- **1 John 2:1** - "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous"
  - Christ as our defense attorney

- **Zechariah 3:1-5** - Joshua and the filthy garments
  - Satan's accusations
  - Christ's defense and transforming power
  - _Speaking note: "Christ doesn't deny our sinfulness but provides His perfect record in place of our faulty one."_

## VIII. Living in the Day of Atonement: Our Response

- **Joel 2:12-17** - Call to deep consecration
  - Heart-searching and repentance

- Practical steps for Day of Atonement living:
  1. **Psalm 139:23-24** - Invite divine heart-examination
  2. **Matthew 5:23-24** - Reconcile broken relationships
  3. **Hebrews 12:1-2** - Remove hindrances to spiritual progress
  4. **Romans 13:11-14** - Live with urgency of final preparation
  - _Speaking note: "Living in the antitypical Day of Atonement means aligning ourselves with Christ's cleansing work—cooperating with Him in heaven and on earth."_

## Conclusion and Appeal

- **Revelation 21:3** - Ultimate fulfillment of sanctuary purpose
  - "The tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them"
  - _Speaking note: "The sanctuary's ultimate purpose will be fulfilled when God dwells directly with His people—all symbolism points toward this glorious reality."_

- Appeal for decision:
  - Will you accept Christ as your High Priest and Advocate?
  - Will you cooperate with His cleansing work in your life?
  - Will you live with awareness of judgment hour urgency?
  - _Speaking note: "Christ's ministry isn't automatic—it must be personally accepted. Today He invites you to place your case in His hands."_
