# The Spirit of Prophecy: God's Endtime Gift to His Remnant Church

**Tags:** #spirit-of-prophecy #Ellen-White #remnant-church #prophetic-gift #end-time #testimonies

**Opening Hymn:** #256 "Ye Servants of the Lord"
"Ye servants of the Lord, each in your office wait, observant of His heavenly Word, and watchful at His gate. Let all your lamps be bright, and trim the golden flame; gird up your loins as in His sight, for awesome is His name."

**Closing Hymn:** #602 "O Brother, Be Faithful"
"O brother, be faithful! soon Jesus will come, For whom we have waited so long; O, soon we shall enter our glorious home, And join in the conqueror's song. O brother, be faithful! for why should we prove unfaithful to Him who has shown such deep love?"

**Central Bible Verse:** Revelation 12:17 - "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."

## Introduction (7 minutes)

- Welcome and opening prayer
- **Revelation 19:10** - "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy"
- Two identifying marks of God's remnant people:
  1. They keep God's commandments
  2. They have the testimony of Jesus (the spirit of prophecy)
- **2 Chronicles 20:20** - "Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper"
- _Speaking note: "God's prophetic guidance is like a lighthouse on a stormy shore—not replacing the map (Bible), but helping navigate dangerous waters that could shipwreck our faith. Tonight we'll explore why this gift is essential, how to use it properly, and why many today miss its blessing."_
- Preview of main points we'll cover today

## I. The Biblical Foundation for Prophetic Guidance (10 minutes)

- **Amos 3:7** - "Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets"
- God's consistent pattern throughout Scripture:

  - **Numbers 12:6** - "If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream"
  - **1 Samuel 3:19-21** - "The LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD"
  - _Speaking note: "Notice God doesn't say He 'might' reveal His plans through prophets—He says He 'will do nothing' without this revelation. It's His established communication method throughout sacred history."_

- The New Testament continuation of prophetic gifts:

  - **Ephesians 4:11-13** - Prophets listed among gifts Christ gave the church "till we all come in the unity of the faith"
  - **1 Corinthians 12:28** - "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets..."
  - **Acts 2:17-18** - Peter quoting Joel's prophecy about the last days: "your sons and your daughters shall prophesy"
  - _Speaking note: "The prophetic gift doesn't end with Malachi or John the Revelator—Scripture clearly teaches it continues until Christ's return. Just as a construction project needs ongoing supervision until completion, God's church needs prophetic guidance until its final perfection."_

- Why the prophetic gift is especially needed in the last days:
  - **Joel 2:28-31** - The outpouring of the Spirit with prophetic manifestations before "the great and terrible day of the LORD"
  - **Matthew 24:24** - Christ's warning about "false prophets" in the last days (implying true ones would also exist)
  - _Speaking note: "If there were to be no true prophets in the last days, Christ would simply have warned against anyone claiming the prophetic gift. Instead, He gave tests to distinguish true from false, indicating both would exist."_

## II. The Spirit of Prophecy as a Mark of the Remnant (12 minutes)

- **Revelation 12:17** - The identifying characteristics of the remnant:
  - "Keep the commandments of God"
  - "Have the testimony of Jesus Christ"
- **Revelation 19:10** - "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy"
- _Speaking note: "These two identifying marks are like spiritual DNA tests that identify God's true end-time people. When we see a movement keeping all God's commandments (including the Sabbath) and blessed with the prophetic gift, Scripture tells us this is the remnant church."_

- Historical manifestation of the prophetic gift in the Advent movement:

  - Brief account of Ellen White's first vision in December 1844
  - How her ministry matched biblical patterns of prophetic calling:
    - **Isaiah 6:5-8** - Initial reluctance (like Isaiah's unworthiness)
    - **Jeremiah 1:6-7** - Feeling inadequate (like Jeremiah's youth)
    - **Daniel 10:8-10** - Physical effects during visions (like Daniel's experience)
  - _Speaking note: "Ellen White didn't seek the prophetic office—it sought her. Her initial physical frailty, youth, and limited education made her an unlikely candidate by human standards, just as many biblical prophets were unlikely choices."_

- Biblical tests for evaluating prophetic claims:
  1. **Isaiah 8:20** - Agreement with Scripture: "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them"
  2. **Deuteronomy 18:21-22** - Fulfillment of predictions: "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass... the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously"
  3. **Matthew 7:15-20** - The fruit test: "By their fruits ye shall know them"
  4. **1 John 4:2-3** - Confession of Christ: "Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God"
  - _Speaking note: "These tests are like spiritual litmus paper—they help us distinguish true prophetic guidance from counterfeit. When applied to Ellen White's 70+ years of ministry, these tests confirm her prophetic gift."_

## III. The Purpose and Function of the Spirit of Prophecy (12 minutes) [*]

- **Hosea 12:13** - "By a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved"
- The dual function of prophetic ministry: guidance and preservation
- _Speaking note: "The prophetic gift serves like both a GPS and an immune system for God's people—providing direction forward and protection from spiritual disease. Without it, Israel would have never found their way out of Egypt or survived the wilderness."_

- Five key purposes of the Spirit of Prophecy in the remnant church:

  1. **John 16:13** - Guiding into all truth: "When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth"

     - _Speaking note: "Ellen White's writings consistently direct us back to Scripture—magnifying biblical truth rather than replacing it. Like a telescope doesn't create stars but helps us see existing ones more clearly, her writings help us see biblical truths we might otherwise miss."_

  2. **John 14:29** - Preparing God's people for coming events: "And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe"

     - _Speaking note: "Prophetic guidance is like an early warning system. It doesn't prevent the storm but helps us prepare for it. From health reform to educational guidance, the Spirit of Prophecy has consistently prepared us for challenges before they arose."_

  3. **2 Chronicles 36:15-16** - Calling God's people back to faithfulness: "The LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people"

     - _Speaking note: "Like a good parent who calls out when a child strays toward danger, God sends prophetic messages to redirect His people when they begin to wander. This is always an act of love, not control or punishment."_

  4. **2 Timothy 3:16-17** - Practical guidance for living: "That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works"

     - _Speaking note: "The prophetic gift takes eternal principles from Scripture and applies them to specific circumstances. It's like taking architectural blueprints and showing how they apply to the actual building materials and terrain of our time."_

  5. **Isaiah 30:21** - Personal encouragement and correction: "And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left"
     - _Speaking note: "One of the most precious aspects of the Spirit of Prophecy is how it speaks to our personal journey. When reading Ellen White's counsel, many have felt God speaking directly to their situation, providing specific guidance for their unique challenges."_

## IV. Common Misunderstandings and Their Correction (10 minutes) [*]

- **2 Peter 3:15-16** - Even Scripture can be "wrested" or misunderstood by those who are "unlearned and unstable"
- _Speaking note: "Just as some distort Scripture to their own destruction, others misunderstand or misuse the Spirit of Prophecy. These misunderstandings create unnecessary barriers to receiving its blessing."_

- Four common misunderstandings:

  1. Misconception: "The Spirit of Prophecy replaces or equals Scripture"

     - Correction from Ellen White's own words: "The testimonies of Sister White should not be carried to the front. God's Word is the unerring standard... Let all prove their positions from the Scriptures and substantiate every point they claim as truth from the revealed Word of God." _(Evangelism, p. 256)_
     - **Isaiah 8:20** - "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them"
     - _Speaking note: "Think of the Bible as the Constitution, and the Spirit of Prophecy as Supreme Court decisions that apply constitutional principles to specific cases. The Constitution always stands supreme, yet the decisions help us understand its application."_

  2. Misconception: "The Spirit of Prophecy is outdated and irrelevant today"

     - **Ecclesiastes 1:9-10** - "There is no new thing under the sun"
     - **2 Timothy 3:16-17** - "All scripture... is profitable" (principle of timeless truth)
     - _Speaking note: "While cultural applications may change, human nature and spiritual principles remain constant. The psychology of temptation, the process of character development, and the principles of healthful living are as relevant today as when first written."_

  3. Misconception: "The Spirit of Prophecy is primarily about rules and restrictions"

     - **1 John 5:3** - "His commandments are not grievous"
     - _Speaking note: "Many view Ellen White's counsel as a list of 'don'ts' rather than seeing the freedom and joy she describes in living according to God's principles. This is like seeing only the fence around a playground without noticing the wonderful equipment inside that the fence protects."_

  4. Misconception: "You can't be saved without accepting the Spirit of Prophecy"
     - **Acts 10:34-35** - "God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him"
     - _Speaking note: "Salvation comes through Jesus Christ alone. The Spirit of Prophecy is a gift to help us understand Him better and walk more closely with Him—not an additional requirement for salvation. It's like a tour guide in an unfamiliar city—you can find your way without one, but your journey will be much more difficult and less enriching."_

## V. How to Receive Maximum Benefit from This Gift (10 minutes)

- **Matthew 13:57-58** - "And they were offended in him... And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief"
- _Speaking note: "Just as Jesus' own hometown missed His blessing through unbelief, many Adventists miss the blessing of the Spirit of Prophecy through neglect or misapplication. Let's explore how to receive its full benefit."_

- Practical principles for receiving benefit:

  1. Read it for yourself rather than relying on secondhand information

     - **Acts 17:11** - "They received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so"
     - _Speaking note: "Many opinions about Ellen White's writings come from those who've never actually read them. This is like forming an opinion about a book based only on reviews without reading it yourself."_

  2. Begin with the most accessible, practical books

     - Recommended starting points: Steps to Christ, Christ's Object Lessons, Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing
     - _Speaking note: "You wouldn't begin studying mathematics with advanced calculus. Similarly, start with Ellen White's most accessible works before tackling more complex ones. Her devotional books provide an excellent introduction to her ministry."_

  3. Apply principles rather than merely adopting specific applications

     - **2 Corinthians 3:6** - "The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life"
     - _Speaking note: "When reading historical counsels, ask 'What principle is being taught here?' rather than simply adopting the specific application from a different era. For example, the principle of modest dress remains constant, while specific styles naturally change with time."_

  4. Read comprehensively rather than selectively

     - **2 Peter 1:20** - "No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation"
     - _Speaking note: "Cherry-picking isolated statements from Ellen White's writings is like trying to understand a novel by reading random sentences. Her counsels must be understood within the context of her entire ministry and the progressive nature of God's revelation."_

  5. Balance study with personal application
     - **James 1:22** - "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves"
     - _Speaking note: "The Spirit of Prophecy wasn't given merely for theological information, but for transformation. Reading without applying is like studying a map without taking the journey—intellectually stimulating perhaps, but ultimately pointless."_

## VI. The Spirit of Prophecy in Your Daily Life (6 minutes)

- **Lamentations 3:22-23** - "His compassions fail not. They are new every morning"
- _Speaking note: "God's prophetic guidance isn't just for the church corporately, but for you personally. It speaks to the most practical aspects of daily living."_

- Three areas of particular blessing:

  1. Personal devotional life

     - Guidance for prayer, Bible study, and communion with God
     - _Speaking note: "Ellen White's writings contain some of the most beautiful portrayals of what communion with God can be like. Many have found their prayer life transformed through her practical counsel on how to cultivate God's presence."_

  2. Family relationships

     - Counsel for marriage, parenting, and home atmosphere
     - **Joshua 24:15** - "As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD"
     - _Speaking note: "In an age of family breakdown, Ellen White's counsel on home life provides a blueprint for relationships built on Christian principles. Her guidance helps create homes where angels love to dwell."_

  3. Health and wellness
     - Balance of physical, mental, and spiritual health
     - **3 John 2** - "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth"
     - _Speaking note: "Long before modern research confirmed it, Ellen White taught the connection between physical and spiritual health. Her health principles have stood the test of time, with science consistently validating what she wrote over a century ago."_

## Conclusion and Appeal (8 minutes)

- **Proverbs 29:18** - "Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he"
- _Speaking note: "It's no coincidence that this verse links vision (prophetic guidance) with law-keeping—the very two characteristics of the remnant in Revelation 12:17. Without prophetic vision, people lose their way; without law-keeping, they lose their boundaries. God's remnant needs both."_

- Summary of main points:

  1. The prophetic gift is biblically established as continuing until Christ's return
  2. The Spirit of Prophecy is a identifying mark of God's remnant people
  3. Its purpose is to guide, preserve, and prepare God's people for the end time
  4. When properly understood and applied, it brings tremendous blessing

- Personal testimony about a specific instance where the Spirit of Prophecy provided guidance in my ministry

  - _Speaking note: "I remember facing a crucial decision in ministry where I felt torn between two apparently good options. Reading Testimonies to Ministers brought a clear principle to light that helped me see God's direction. This isn't about receiving new revelation, but about seeing biblical principles applied to specific situations."_

- **2 Chronicles 20:20** - "Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper"
- Final appeal:

  - For those unfamiliar with the Spirit of Prophecy: Would you be willing to read Steps to Christ this week with an open heart?
  - For those who've neglected this gift: Would you commit to incorporating Ellen White's devotional books into your regular reading?
  - For those already benefiting: Would you share a specific book that has blessed you with someone else this month?

- _Speaking note: "God offers this gift because He understands our weaknesses and slowness of understanding. Like a loving parent who provides not only verbal directions but also a map, a GPS, and occasional phone calls to guide a traveling child, God has given us His Word and the Spirit of Prophecy because He wants us to arrive safely home."_

- Closing prayer thanking God for the gift of the Spirit of Prophecy and asking for wisdom to apply it correctly
