**Tags:** #sabbath #creation #fourth-commandment #rest #worship #sanctification

**Opening Hymn:** #382 "Have Thine Own Way, Lord"
"Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! Thou art the Potter, I am the clay. Mold me and make me after Thy will, While I am waiting, yielded and still."

**Closing Hymn:** #388 "Don't Forget the Sabbath"
"Don't forget the Sabbath, The Lord our God hath blest, Of all the week the brightest, Of all the week the best; It brings repose from labor, It tells of joy divine, Its beams of light descending, With heavenly beauty shine."

**Central Bible Verse:** Exodus 20:8-11 - "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

## Introduction: The Sabbath as Divine Gift

- **Genesis 2:1-3** - God established the Sabbath at Creation, before sin, before Israel
  - _Speaking note: "The Sabbath isn't merely a Jewish institution—it predates all nations, races, and religions. It was God's gift to all humanity at Creation, a weekly oasis of time in an increasingly time-starved world."_
- **Mark 2:27** - "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath"
  - The Sabbath as blessing, not burden
  - _Speaking note: "Think of the Sabbath as a weekly appointment with the Creator of the universe—imagine turning down a weekly dinner invitation from the President! Yet God offers us something far greater each Sabbath."_

## I. The Sabbath's Divine Origin and Purpose

- **Ezekiel 20:12, 20** - "I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them"

  - The Sabbath as a sign of Creation and Redemption
  - _Speaking note: "The Sabbath is like God's signature on the masterpiece of Creation—an artist signs their work to establish ownership and authenticity."_

- Three primary purposes of the Sabbath:

  1. **Commemoration** - Remembering Creation and God as Creator

     - **Exodus 20:11** - "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth..."
     - _Speaking note: "Each Sabbath is an anniversary celebration of Creation week—a time to marvel at the cosmos, from distant galaxies to the intricate design of a hummingbird's wing."_

  2. **Sanctification** - Setting apart time for spiritual renewal

     - **Exodus 31:13** - "...that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you"
     - _Speaking note: "The Sabbath works like spiritual gardening time—weeding out worldly preoccupations and nurturing our relationship with God. Without regular gardening, weeds quickly overtake the tender plants."_

  3. **Anticipation** - Foreshadowing eternal rest in God's kingdom
     - **Hebrews 4:9-10** - "There remaineth therefore a rest [Sabbatismos - Sabbath rest] to the people of God"
     - _Speaking note: "The weekly Sabbath is like a down payment on eternity—a small taste now of the perfect communion with God we'll enjoy forever."_

## II. The Sabbath Through Biblical History

- **Genesis 2:1-3** - Established at Creation

  - Not an afterthought or ceremonial addition
  - _Speaking note: "God didn't simply create the Sabbath—He created time itself, then sanctified a portion of it specifically for relationship with humanity."_

- **Exodus 16:4-5, 22-30** - Observed before Sinai (manna provision)

  - God taught Sabbath observance through the miracle of manna
  - Double portion on sixth day, none on Sabbath
  - _Speaking note: "Notice how God trained Israel in Sabbath observance before giving the Ten Commandments—like parents teach children to say 'please' and 'thank you' before they understand the full concept of gratitude."_

- **Exodus 20:8-11** - Codified in the moral law

  - Part of the Decalogue, written by God's finger
  - _Speaking note: "Unlike the ceremonial laws that were written by Moses in a book, the Sabbath command was engraved by God's own finger in stone—symbolizing its enduring nature."_

- **Isaiah 56:1-8** - Extended to all nations in prophetic vision

  - Foreign converts and eunuchs included in Sabbath blessing
  - _Speaking note: "Far from being merely Jewish, Isaiah reveals God's intention for the Sabbath to bless all humanity—it's a universal gift, not an exclusive privilege."_

- **Luke 4:16** - Observed by Jesus as His custom

  - Jesus our perfect example kept the Sabbath faithfully
  - _Speaking note: "If Jesus, who called Himself 'Lord of the Sabbath,' considered Sabbath worship His regular custom, shouldn't His followers do the same?"_

- **Acts 13:14, 42-44; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4** - Observed by apostles and early church
  - Paul's pattern: reasoning in synagogues on Sabbath
  - Gentile believers requested teaching on Sabbath
  - _Speaking note: "Note the absence of any controversy about Sabbath observance in the New Testament church—the focus was on how to observe it properly, not whether to observe it at all."_

## III. The Sabbath's Biblical Calculation: Which Day Is the Seventh Day?

- **Luke 23:54-56; 24:1** - The day between Good Friday and Easter Sunday

  - Women rested on Sabbath between crucifixion and resurrection
  - _Speaking note: "Even in the darkest hour of earth's history, the Sabbath remained sacred. The women who loved Jesus most chose to wait until after Sabbath to complete His burial preparations."_

- **Exodus 16:22-30** - God identified the seventh day through manna

  - No manna fell on Sabbath for 40 years (over 2,000 consecutive weeks)
  - _Speaking note: "For forty years, God performed a weekly miracle—2,080 consecutive Sabbaths with no manna—to eliminate any confusion about which day was the seventh day."_

- **Luke 4:16** - Jesus kept the same Sabbath the Jews observed

  - Historical continuity of the weekly cycle
  - _Speaking note: "Jesus never corrected the Jewish understanding of which day was Sabbath—something He certainly would have done if they were observing the wrong day."_

- Historical evidence for weekly cycle continuity
  - No historical record of weekly cycle change
  - Calendar changes affected only the numbering of days, not the sequence of the week
  - _Speaking note: "Unlike months and years, which are based on lunar and solar cycles, the seven-day week is based solely on divine command—a perpetual reminder of our Creator."_

## IV. Sabbath vs. Sunday: Examining the Change

- **Daniel 7:25** - Prophecy of power that would "think to change times and laws"

  - _Speaking note: "Daniel predicted a religious authority would attempt to alter God's sacred times—not that God would authorize such a change."_

- **Acts 20:7-12** - Examines the sole "first day" meeting in Acts

  - Saturday night meeting (Jewish reckoning of days)
  - Special farewell occasion, not regular worship
  - _Speaking note: "This was a special farewell meeting, not evidence of regular Sunday worship. Notice Paul continued his journey the next day, Sunday—hardly appropriate if it had become a new holy day."_

- **1 Corinthians 16:1-2** - Instructions for setting aside offerings

  - Private act of financial planning, not public worship
  - _Speaking note: "Paul was simply advising believers to do their financial accounting at home on the first day of the week, after the Sabbath had ended—similar to how we might balance our checkbooks on Monday."_

- Historical admission of Sunday substitution
  - Quotations from various denominations acknowledging the change
  - Absence of biblical authorization for the change
  - _Speaking note: "Many honest Christian historians and theologians admit there is no biblical command to observe Sunday in place of the seventh-day Sabbath."_

## V. The Sabbath Experience: Making It a Delight

- **Isaiah 58:13-14** - "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight..."

  - Balance between restrictions and celebrations
  - _Speaking note: "The Sabbath is like a garden with a fence around it—the fence (restrictions) exists only to protect the beauty within, not as an end in itself."_

- Preparation for Sabbath

  - **Exodus 16:22-23** - Preparation day concept
  - **Luke 23:54-56** - Preparation before Sabbath begins
  - _Speaking note: "Just as a special dinner guest deserves preparation—cleaning the house, preparing special food—so our Heavenly Guest deserves preparation for His weekly visit."_
  - Practical applications:
    - Physical preparation: food, clothes, home
    - Mental preparation: resolving conflicts, planning rest
    - Spiritual preparation: special worship start to welcome Sabbath

- Appropriate Sabbath activities

  - **Matthew 12:1-13** - Jesus' examples of appropriate Sabbath activities
    - Works of necessity (eating)
    - Works of mercy (healing)
  - _Speaking note: "Jesus demonstrated that Sabbath restrictions should never prevent meeting genuine human needs. The guiding principle is 'Is this activity drawing me closer to God and serving others in love?'"_
  - Activities that honor God:
    - Worship and Bible study
    - Nature exploration and appreciation
    - Service to others
    - Rest and family time
  - Activities that detract from Sabbath's purpose:
    - Commercial transactions
    - Secular entertainment
    - Regular work and household chores
    - Mentally preoccupying activities

- **Mark 2:27-28** - Jesus as Lord of the Sabbath gives proper interpretive framework
  - _Speaking note: "As Lord of the Sabbath, Jesus is the perfect interpreter of how to observe it. We look to His example, not to rigid rules or careless disregard."_

## VI. The End-Time Significance of the Sabbath

- **Revelation 14:6-12** - The Three Angels' Messages include call to worship Creator

  - **Revelation 14:7** - "Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea" (echoing Exodus 20:11)
  - _Speaking note: "The end-time call to worship the Creator directly quotes from the Sabbath commandment—connecting Sabbath observance with end-time faithfulness."_

- **Revelation 13:16-17** - The mark of the beast as counterfeit to God's seal

  - Contrast between God's authority (Sabbath) and human authority (Sunday)
  - _Speaking note: "The final test will center on authority—God's authority expressed in His commandments versus human authority expressed in human traditions. The Sabbath stands as the most visible expression of whose authority we accept."_

- **Isaiah 66:22-23** - Sabbath observance continues in the new earth
  - Not temporary or dispensational, but eternal
  - _Speaking note: "The Sabbath spans human history from Eden lost to Eden restored—it begins in a perfect world and continues in the perfect world to come."_

## VII. Practical Steps for Sabbath Keepers

- For new Sabbath observers:

  - Begin Sabbath preparation earlier in the week
  - Communicate with family, employers, and teachers
  - Connect with supportive faith community
  - _Speaking note: "Sabbath-keeping is like learning any new skill—it takes practice to develop the rhythm. Be patient with yourself and keep the focus on relationship with God, not perfect performance."_

- For growing Sabbath keepers:

  - Move beyond "don'ts" to "do's"
  - Create meaningful Sabbath traditions
  - Invite others to experience Sabbath blessing
  - _Speaking note: "After learning the boundaries of Sabbath, focus on filling it with delight—special foods, meaningful activities, deeper relationships, and spiritual growth."_

- For mature Sabbath keepers:
  - Mentor others in Sabbath principles
  - Deepen Sabbath spiritual disciplines
  - Advocate for Sabbath principles in society
  - _Speaking note: "As experienced Sabbath-keepers, you become interpreters of this gift to others—showing them not just the rules, but the relationship at its core."_

## Conclusion and Appeal

- **Hebrews 4:9-11** - "There remaineth therefore a rest [Sabbatismos] to the people of God"

  - The double application: weekly Sabbath and eternal rest
  - _Speaking note: "The weekly Sabbath is both a memorial of Creation past and a foretaste of restoration future. Each Sabbath, we practice for eternity."_

- **Isaiah 58:13-14** - Promise of delight and God's blessing through Sabbath observance

  - _Speaking note: "God doesn't request Sabbath observance to restrict our joy, but to enhance it—it's like a parent limiting screen time not to punish a child, but to give them something better."_

- Appeal for decision:
  - For those new to Sabbath truth: Will you honor God by keeping His Sabbath holy?
  - For current Sabbath keepers: Will you renew your commitment to making Sabbath a delight?
  - For all: Will you prepare to stand faithfully in the final test over God's commandments?
  - _Speaking note: "The Sabbath is not just about a day, but about a relationship with the Lord of the Sabbath. Today, Jesus invites you to enter His rest."_
