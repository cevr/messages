# From Altar to Heart: Ancient Offerings and Modern Grace

**Tags:** #sin-offerings #sacrifice #atonement #sanctuary #repentance #practical-holiness

**Opening Hymn:** #294 "Power in the Blood"
"Would you be free from the burden of sin? There's power in the blood, power in the blood; Would you o'er evil a victory win? There's wonderful power in the blood. There is power, power, wonder-working power in the blood of the Lamb; There is power, power, wonder-working power in the precious blood of the Lamb."

**Closing Hymn:** #316 "Live Out Thy Life Within Me"
"Live out Thy life within me, O Jesus, King of kings! Be Thou Thyself the answer to all my questionings; Live out Thy life within me, in all things have Thy way! I, the transparent medium, Thy glory to display."

**Central Bible Verse:** Leviticus 4:35 - "And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him."

## Introduction: God's Visual Curriculum for Sin's Solution

- **Hebrews 10:1-4** - "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
  - The sacrificial system as divine object lesson
  - _Speaking note: "The sanctuary offerings weren't merely ancient religious rituals but God's kindergarten curriculum—teaching complex spiritual truths through tangible symbols. Like a preschool teacher uses colored blocks to teach math concepts, God used animals, blood, and altars to teach salvation concepts."_

- **1 Corinthians 10:11** - "Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
  - Ancient ceremonies designed for modern application
  - _Speaking note: "These sacrificial rituals may seem distant and archaic, but Scripture says they were recorded specifically for us living in the end times. They're not merely historical artifacts but spiritual guidebooks for 21st-century Christians."_

## I. The Five Major Offerings: Overview of the Levitical System

- **Leviticus 1-7** - God's comprehensive system for addressing sin and worship
  - _Speaking note: "The five offerings of Leviticus form a complete spiritual curriculum—covering everything from atonement for sin to joyful communion with God. They're like five chapters in God's textbook on restoration."_

- The five offerings and their primary purposes:
  1. **Burnt Offering** (Leviticus 1) - Complete dedication
  2. **Grain/Meal Offering** (Leviticus 2) - Thanksgiving and service
  3. **Peace Offering** (Leviticus 3) - Fellowship and communion
  4. **Sin Offering** (Leviticus 4:1-5:13) - Atonement for unintentional sins
  5. **Trespass/Guilt Offering** (Leviticus 5:14-6:7) - Restitution for specific wrongs
  - _Speaking note: "These five offerings address every aspect of our relationship with God—from dealing with specific sins to expressing gratitude and dedication. Together they paint a complete picture of spiritual life."_

- **Hebrews 9:22** - "And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."
  - Centrality of substitutionary sacrifice
  - _Speaking note: "Blood sacrifice wasn't God's way of demanding payment but His way of illustrating the cost of sin—that it inevitably brings death. Every bleeding lamb whispered, 'Messiah is coming. This is what sin will cost Him.'"_

## II. The Sin Offering: Addressing Unintentional Transgressions

- **Leviticus 4:1-2** - "And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD..."
  - Definition and purpose of sin offering
  - _Speaking note: "The sin offering addressed unintentional sins—violations committed through ignorance, mistake, or spiritual carelessness. It teaches that even sins we're unaware of require atonement, that ignorance doesn't eliminate guilt."_

- Four categories of offenders with different requirements:
  1. **Leviticus 4:3-12** - For the anointed priest
     - Bull without blemish
     - Blood sprinkled seven times before the veil
     - Some blood on incense altar horns
     - Remainder poured at base of burnt altar
     - Fat burned on altar
     - Remainder of bull burned outside camp
     - _Speaking note: "The highest spiritual leader had the highest responsibility—his sin affected the entire community. Compare this with James 3:1, 'My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.' Spiritual leadership brings greater accountability."_

  2. **Leviticus 4:13-21** - For the entire congregation
     - Similar requirements as for the priest
     - Elders lay hands on bull's head
     - _Speaking note: "Corporate sin requires corporate repentance. Just as ancient Israel could sin as a community, so can modern churches drift into compromises that require collective acknowledgment and correction."_

  3. **Leviticus 4:22-26** - For the ruler/leader
     - Male goat without blemish
     - Blood on horns of burnt altar
     - Fat burned on altar
     - _Speaking note: "Political and community leaders bear special responsibility for their influence. Their character and decisions affect many lives, requiring a unique offering—different from both priest and common person."_

  4. **Leviticus 4:27-35** - For the common person
     - Female goat or lamb
     - Blood on horns of burnt altar
     - Fat burned on altar
     - _Speaking note: "God's requirements scale according to responsibility and influence. Even the poorest Israelite could afford a female goat or lamb—God never demands what we cannot provide."_

- Special provision for the poor:
  - **Leviticus 5:7-13** - Turtledoves, pigeons, or fine flour
  - _Speaking note: "God's mercy accommodates economic reality—even the poorest person could bring turtledoves or a handful of flour. Sin requires atonement, but God ensures the path to forgiveness is accessible to all regardless of social standing. No one is excluded from forgiveness due to poverty."_

## III. The Trespass/Guilt Offering: Making Specific Wrongs Right

- **Leviticus 5:14-6:7** - Addressing sins requiring restitution
  - _Speaking note: "While the sin offering dealt with general unintentional sin, the trespass offering addressed specific wrongs against God or others—especially those involving property, sacred things, or measurable damages."_

- Categories of trespass requiring this offering:
  1. **Leviticus 5:14-16** - Sins against "holy things"
     - Unintentional misuse of sacred items
     - Ram for sacrifice
     - Financial restitution plus 20% penalty
     - _Speaking note: "This offering addressed mishandling what belongs to God—like using tithe for personal expenses or treating sacred commitments casually. It teaches reverence for what is dedicated to God."_

  2. **Leviticus 5:17-19** - Suspected but uncertain violations
     - Ram for sacrifice
     - _Speaking note: "Even when unsure if we've sinned, this offering provided peace of conscience. It teaches that unresolved guilt damages our relationship with God and needs addressing even when details are unclear."_

  3. **Leviticus 6:1-7** - Sins against neighbors
     - Fraud, theft, deception, false witness
     - Ram for sacrifice
     - Full restitution plus 20% penalty
     - _Speaking note: "God considers sins against others to be sins against Himself. This offering teaches that reconciliation with God requires making things right with those we've wronged—mere ritual without restitution is inadequate."_

- **Matthew 5:23-24** - Christ's teaching parallel
  - Reconciliation before worship
  - _Speaking note: "Jesus echoed this principle in teaching that we should reconcile with others before offering worship to God. Our vertical relationship with God is intimately connected to our horizontal relationships with others."_

## IV. The Ritual Process: Elements and Meaning

- **Leviticus 4:27-31** - Steps in the sin offering process:
  1. Selection of appropriate animal
     - Unblemished, specific to offerer's status
     - _Speaking note: "The unblemished animal foreshadowed the perfect Christ who would be 'without spot or blemish' (1 Peter 1:19). Only a perfect sacrifice could atone for imperfect humans."_

  2. Laying hands on animal's head
     - Symbolic transfer of guilt to innocent substitute
     - _Speaking note: "This gesture of hand-laying was the symbolic transfer of sin—the visual representation of Isaiah 53:6, 'The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.' The innocent literally carried the guilty one's sin."_

  3. Offerer (not priest) slaying the animal
     - Personal responsibility for sin's consequence
     - _Speaking note: "Notice who killed the sacrifice—not the priest, but the sinner himself. This powerful object lesson taught personal responsibility for sin's consequences. In a sense, our sins drove the nails into Christ's hands."_

  4. Priest applying blood
     - Different applications for different offerings
     - _Speaking note: "The priest's handling of blood represented divine mediation—the human priest foreshadowing Christ's mediatorial work applying His own blood on our behalf."_

  5. Burning specified portions
     - Fat portions as "sweet savor" to the Lord
     - _Speaking note: "The burning fat, releasing an aroma, represented satisfaction of divine justice. Just as a pleasing aroma satisfies hunger, so the sacrifice satisfied God's requirements for justice."_

- Key symbolic elements:
  1. **Blood** - Life given in substitution
     - **Leviticus 17:11** - "For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls"
     - _Speaking note: "Blood represents life—not merely death, but life poured out substitutionally. When the New Testament speaks of being 'washed in the blood,' it means being cleansed by Christ's life given for us."_

  2. **Laying on of hands** - Transfer of guilt
     - **Isaiah 53:5-6** - "The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all"
     - _Speaking note: "This physical gesture visually enacted the spiritual reality of substitutionary atonement—the innocent literally carrying the guilty one's sin."_

  3. **Fat portions** - Best given to God
     - **Leviticus 3:16** - "All the fat is the LORD's"
     - _Speaking note: "In ancient Israel, fat represented the best, richest part—giving it to God symbolized offering our very best. Today, we similarly give God our 'fat'—our first and best time, energy, resources, and talents."_

  4. **Outside the camp** - Removal of sin
     - **Leviticus 4:12** - "Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp... and burn him on the wood with fire"
     - **Hebrews 13:11-13** - Christ suffering "outside the gate"
     - _Speaking note: "The burning of sin offerings outside the camp foreshadowed Christ being crucified outside Jerusalem—both symbolizing sin's removal from God's presence. Christ literally became sin for us (2 Corinthians 5:21) and bore our shame 'outside the camp.'"_

## V. Christ: The Fulfillment of All Offerings

- **Hebrews 10:1-14** - Christ's single sacrifice replacing all offerings
  - _Speaking note: "The multiple offerings of Leviticus were like individual puzzle pieces—each revealing one aspect of Christ's complete work. Jesus fulfilled every offering simultaneously in His single sacrifice."_

- How Christ fulfilled each specific offering:
  1. Sin Offering fulfillment:
     - **2 Corinthians 5:21** - "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin"
     - **Romans 8:3** - "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh"
     - _Speaking note: "Just as sin offerings were burned 'outside the camp,' Christ suffered outside Jerusalem's gate—bearing our sin and its penalty completely away from God's presence."_

  2. Trespass Offering fulfillment:
     - **Isaiah 53:10** - "When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin [asham/trespass offering]"
     - **Ephesians 1:7** - "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins"
     - **Colossians 2:13-14** - "Having forgiven you all trespasses; Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances"
     - _Speaking note: "The trespass offering required restitution. Christ not only took our penalty but made full restitution for our moral debts—paying what we owed but could never repay."_

- **Hebrews 9:11-14** - The perfect sacrifice requiring no repetition
  - _Speaking note: "The Levitical offerings required constant repetition—highlighting their incompleteness. Christ's one sacrifice was so perfect it eliminated the need for repetition, solving the sin problem permanently."_

## VI. Modern Applications: Sin Offering Principles for Today

- **1 John 1:7-9** - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"
  - The continuing need for confession and cleansing
  - _Speaking note: "Though we no longer bring animal sacrifices, the spiritual principles behind the sin offering remain: we must acknowledge our sins specifically, trust in the blood of the Substitute, and accept divine cleansing."_

- Principles from the sin offering for modern application:
  1. All sin requires atonement
     - **Romans 3:23** - "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"
     - _Speaking note: "The sin offering teaches that all sin—even unintentional or ignorant—requires atonement. Similarly, we must recognize that even our 'small' or unconscious sins need Christ's blood. Cultural blindspots and 'acceptable sins' still need atonement."_
     - Modern application:
       - Regular self-examination (Psalm 139:23-24)
       - Sensitivity to Holy Spirit's conviction
       - Avoiding categorizing sins as "no big deal"

  2. Sin is transferred to the Substitute
     - **Isaiah 53:4-6** - "The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all"
     - _Speaking note: "Just as the Israelite physically transferred guilt through hand-laying, we must consciously transfer our guilt to Christ—not merely acknowledging sin intellectually, but personally applying Christ's sacrifice to our specific failures."_
     - Modern application:
       - Specific confession rather than generic
       - Visualization of sin's transfer to Christ
       - Rejection of continued false guilt after confession

  3. Personal responsibility in confession
     - **Proverbs 28:13** - "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy"
     - _Speaking note: "The Israelite, not the priest, slew the sacrifice—illustrating personal responsibility. Similarly, we can't outsource our confession to others; each person must individually acknowledge sin and seek forgiveness."_
     - Modern application:
       - Taking ownership without blame-shifting
       - Specific rather than vague confession
       - Direct approach to God without human intermediaries

  4. Cleansing is God's work, not ours
     - **Micah 7:18-19** - "Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity... thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea"
     - _Speaking note: "After the Israelite confessed sin and provided the sacrifice, the priest performed the cleansing ritual. We confess, but God does the cleansing work—we can't scrub away our own guilt through penance or good works."_
     - Modern application:
       - Trusting Christ's work rather than self-punishment
       - Accepting forgiveness as complete, not partial
       - Living in freedom rather than continued shame

## VII. Modern Applications: Trespass Offering Principles for Today

- **Matthew 5:23-24** - "First be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift"
  - Making relationships right before worship
  - _Speaking note: "The trespass offering's insistence on restitution parallels Christ's teaching that reconciliation with others must precede acceptable worship. Our vertical relationship with God depends partly on our horizontal relationships with people."_

- Principles from the trespass offering for modern application:
  1. Restitution is necessary where possible
     - **Luke 19:8-9** - Zacchaeus: "If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold"
     - _Speaking note: "The trespass offering required 120% repayment—the original amount plus 20% penalty. Likewise, genuine repentance today includes making things right when possible, not merely saying 'sorry.'"_
     - Modern application:
       - Returning or replacing what was taken
       - Repairing damage caused to others
       - Going beyond mere apology to substantive action

  2. Sacred things demand special reverence
     - **Malachi 3:8-10** - "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me... in tithes and offerings"
     - _Speaking note: "The trespass offering addressed misuse of sacred things, teaching that what belongs to God requires careful handling. Today, we show similar reverence by properly managing time, talents, and resources dedicated to God."_
     - Modern application:
       - Honoring commitments made to God
       - Faithful stewardship of tithe and offerings
       - Treating church responsibilities as sacred trusts

  3. Sin affects community, not just individuals
     - **Joshua 7:1, 11-12** - Achan's sin affecting all Israel
     - _Speaking note: "The different offering requirements for leaders versus common people illustrates that sin has communal dimensions—one person's actions affect many. No sin is truly private; all ripple outward to impact others."_
     - Modern application:
       - Recognizing how our choices affect others
       - Taking responsibility for group failures
       - Supporting others in their restoration

  4. Economic status doesn't limit access to forgiveness
     - **Leviticus 5:7-13** - Provision for poor to bring birds or flour
     - _Speaking note: "God's sliding scale of offerings ensured everyone could approach Him regardless of wealth. Similarly, access to divine forgiveness today isn't limited by education, social status, or resources—Christ's blood is equally available to all."_
     - Modern application:
       - Avoiding creating barriers to spiritual access
       - Embracing equality at the foot of the cross
       - Ensuring church practices don't exclude the marginalized

## VIII. Five Practical Steps for Daily Application

- **Psalm 139:23-24** - "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me"
  - Inviting divine examination
  - _Speaking note: "The first step in applying the offerings' principles is allowing God's light to expose what needs cleansing—inviting the Holy Spirit to reveal blind spots and hidden sins we might otherwise miss."_

- Five-step daily practice mirroring offering principles:
  1. **Examination**
     - **1 Corinthians 11:28** - "But let a man examine himself"
     - **Lamentations 3:40** - "Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD"
     - _Speaking note: "Just as Israelites needed to identify which specific offering was required, we need daily self-examination to identify specific areas needing Christ's blood. Schedule regular 'spiritual inventory' times, perhaps at day's end."_
     - Practical technique:
       - Evening review of day's thoughts, words, actions
       - Three-question test: "Was it true? Was it kind? Was it necessary?"
       - Journaling unresolved spiritual issues

  2. **Specific Confession**
     - **1 John 1:9** - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us"
     - **Psalm 32:5** - "I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid"
     - _Speaking note: "The Israelite had to identify the specific offense and appropriate sacrifice. Similarly, effective confession names specific sins rather than vague generalities—not 'Forgive my sins today' but 'Forgive my impatience with my coworker this morning.'"_
     - Practical technique:
       - Naming sins specifically in prayer
       - Avoiding excuses or blame-shifting
       - Confessing promptly rather than accumulating

  3. **Accepting Transfer to Christ**
     - **1 Peter 2:24** - "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree"
     - **Galatians 3:13** - "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us"
     - _Speaking note: "The hand-laying ritual visualized sin's transfer to the innocent substitute. We similarly need to visualize and accept the transfer of our specific sins to Christ—mentally placing them on Him at Calvary."_
     - Practical technique:
       - Visualizing sin being placed on Christ
       - Verbally thanking Christ for specific substitution
       - Meditating on passages describing Christ bearing our sins

  4. **Making Restitution Where Needed**
     - **Matthew 5:23-24** - "First be reconciled to thy brother"
     - **Luke 19:8** - Zacchaeus's fourfold restoration
     - _Speaking note: "Like the trespass offering's 20% penalty, genuine repentance asks, 'What can I do to make this right?' Sometimes a simple apology suffices; other times more substantial restitution is appropriate."_
     - Practical technique:
       - Promptly addressing relational damage
       - Offering appropriate compensation when possible
       - Being generous in making amends (going beyond minimum)

  5. **Living in Freedom from Guilt**
     - **Romans 8:1** - "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus"
     - **Micah 7:19** - "Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea"
     - _Speaking note: "After the offering was complete, the Israelite left legally clean and forgiven. We too must accept the completeness of Christ's cleansing and refuse to retrieve what God has buried—walking in freedom rather than continued guilt."_
     - Practical technique:
       - Rejecting recurring thoughts of forgiven sin
       - Responding to Satan's accusations with Christ's completed work
       - Practicing gratitude for freedom from guilt

## IX. The Psychology of Sin and Sacrifice: Healing Modern Hearts

- **Psalm 32:1-5** - "When I kept silence, my bones waxed old... I acknowledged my sin... and thou forgavest"
  - The psychological burden of unresolved guilt
  - _Speaking note: "David describes the psychological torment of unconfessed sin—physical symptoms, emotional distress, spiritual depletion. Modern psychology confirms what Scripture taught millennia ago: unresolved guilt creates measurable mental and physical harm."_

- Modern psychological insights paralleling offering principles:
  1. Cognitive dissonance from hidden/denied sin
     - **Psalm 32:3-4** - Physical effects of concealed guilt
     - _Speaking note: "Psychology identifies 'cognitive dissonance' as mental stress from contradictory beliefs/actions. The sin offering's emphasis on acknowledgment addresses this—bringing hidden things to light reduces destructive internal conflict."_
     - Application:
       - Journaling as modern "confession"
       - Therapeutic value of verbalized acknowledgment
       - Reduced anxiety through transparency

  2. Substitution as psychological transference
     - **Isaiah 53:4** - "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows"
     - _Speaking note: "The laying of hands on the sacrifice has psychological parallels in 'transference'—the displacement of feelings onto another. Christ offers healthy transference, bearing what would otherwise crush us."_
     - Application:
       - Visualization and release of burdens
       - Freedom from unhealthy defense mechanisms
       - Replacing denial with healthy acceptance

  3. Symbolic action creating psychological closure
     - **Leviticus 16:22** - Scapegoat carrying sins away
     - _Speaking note: "The visual symbolism of sacrifice created psychological closure—seeing sin symbolically removed helped internalize forgiveness. Modern psychology similarly uses symbolism and ritual to mark significant transitions and releases."_
     - Application:
       - Creating personal rituals of release
       - Using symbolic actions to mark forgiveness
       - Writing down sins and destroying the paper

  4. Communal aspect of healing and restoration
     - **Leviticus 4:13-21** - Corporate offerings for corporate sin
     - _Speaking note: "The communal aspect of some offerings finds parallels in group therapy and accountability communities—modern psychology affirms that healing often requires community support."_
     - Application:
       - Accountability partnerships
       - Small group confession (James 5:16)
       - Therapeutic value of witnessed forgiveness

## X. Teaching Children These Principles

- **Deuteronomy 6:6-7** - "These words... shall teach them diligently unto thy children"
  - Translating ancient practices for young minds
  - _Speaking note: "Children may find ancient animal sacrifices disturbing or confusing. We need age-appropriate ways to teach these profound principles without traumatizing young hearts."_

- Age-appropriate teaching methods:
  1. For young children (ages 4-7):
     - **John 1:29** - "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"
     - _Speaking note: "Young children understand concepts of breaking rules, saying sorry, and making things right. Connect these to Jesus as the ultimate 'fixer' who makes our wrongs right with God."_
     - Teaching methods:
       - Object lessons with broken items being repaired
       - Stories of forgiveness and making amends
       - Simple analogies (Jesus erasing mistakes)

  2. For older children (ages 8-12):
     - **Hebrews 9:22** - "Without shedding of blood is no remission"
     - _Speaking note: "Older children can grasp more complex concepts of sacrifice and substitution. Use their growing understanding of consequences to explain Christ's substitutionary role."_
     - Teaching methods:
       - Historical context of sanctuary system
       - Role-playing scenarios of confession and restoration
       - Visual aids showing sanctuary layout and function

  3. For teenagers (ages 13-18):
     - **Romans 12:1** - "Present your bodies a living sacrifice"
     - _Speaking note: "Teenagers grapple with identity and independence. Connect sacrifice principles to their developing moral framework and questions about fairness, justice, and personal responsibility."_
     - Teaching methods:
       - Deeper exploration of typology and symbolism
       - Discussion of psychological aspects of guilt and forgiveness
       - Personal application to teenage social and moral challenges

- **Proverbs 22:6** - "Train up a child in the way he should go"
  - Progressive revelation based on developmental readiness
  - _Speaking note: "Just as the ancient sanctuary system was a 'kindergarten' teaching salvation principles, our teaching should meet children where they are—progressively revealing deeper aspects as they mature."_

## Conclusion and Appeal

- **Hebrews 9:13-14** - "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
  - From ancient shadows to present reality
  - _Speaking note: "The ancient offerings were shadows—Christ is the substance. While we no longer bring animals to stone altars, the spiritual principles of confession, substitution, and restoration remain eternal. Each day, we bring our sins to the cross rather than the altar."_

- **Isaiah 1:18** - "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow"
  - God's invitation to experience cleansing
  - _Speaking note: "These ancient rituals ultimately reveal a God passionate about restoring broken relationships—a God who provides the means of cleansing and invites us to experience it daily."_

- Appeal for decision:
  1. Have you been carrying unconfessed sin? Will you bring it to Christ today?
  2. Are there relationships needing restoration? Will you initiate reconciliation this week?
  3. Will you establish a daily practice of applying these ancient principles to modern life?
  - _Speaking note: "The ancient Israelites left the sanctuary legally clean through the blood of animals. How much greater cleansing is available to us through the actual blood of Christ! Today, you can leave with a clean conscience and a renewed spirit as you apply these timeless principles to your life."_
